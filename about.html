    Hi! My name is Nicholas Marchuk, but I usually go by Nick. I'm an author and mechanical engineer living in Somerville, Massachusetts. I grew up in Dover, New Hampshire, and studied at Boston University.
</p>
<p>
    I play the trombone when I can for the BU Band, the Harvard University Band, as well as the Dirty Water Brass Band. Music has always been an important part of my life.
</p>
<p>
    I love to write books. I see it as a way to express myself and share the way I see the world with other people.
</p>
<p>
    I try to take the craft of writing seriously, but prefer to have fun as I go, and tell stories I think people would like to read. I hope you give one of my books a shot!
