After everything ran clean and was hung out to dry, the day passed into night, and a fire was raised in the camp. A deer had been caught and skinned, and was nearly cooked. The fire colored the brown walls of the cave orange, and darkened her vision of the night, leaving the tops of the canyons to appear like black statues against the deep blue twilight. She felt strongly like she’d entered a vision of a culture from before time, when people hunted on their bare feet and told stories in caves that were older than even them.

The men were gathered around the fire, and they’d begun picking at the venison, pulling the smaller pieces off the fire. El Hermano Mayor was quick to greet her as she walked out, and handed her a chunk. The meat was gamey in taste, and still burning hot from the fire, but she had never tasted anything that was so right for the moment. The others didn’t acknowledge her, focused on their own dinners.

One of the men came around the corner with a clinking case of beers in glass bottles, to a chorus of cheers from the crowd. He began throwing the bottles to each of the men, dancing as he went. He lifted his leg, and tossed a bottle under it. Brooklyn almost didn’t realize it was for her, but caught it at the last moment. She banged it against a stone to get the cap off, and had a sip. She shivered slightly. She probably shouldn’t drink around these men.

El Hermano Mayor stood up, his beer in hand, and began to pace around the fire. The men’s conversation quieted. He stopped, and stretched both his arms outwards. He was a giant man, six and a half feet at least, and with plenty of meat on his bones to spare. He wore a cavernous brown leather jacket loosely over an old ripped shirt, and boots big enough to put her head inside. He seemed to have kind eyes, but who could know something like that?

“I speak often of what happens on the day a man receives a sign,” he spoke. His English was plodding yet sophisticated, his accent only sharpening his speech. “The day a man receives a sign he should be smart enough to listen. He should open his heart and find the little man inside it who can listen to these things, and ask him what he hears. Even I, as large as I am, full of love for all of you, finds this man and talks to him when it is necessary. Today that occasion came upon me.”

“You may notice a woman sits at our table this night. She rides a burro downriver, and walks half dead into our camp, not knowing where she is. Why does she run so? She doesn’t know; she only knows to run. The hated infantry follows in her path. Even now they pursue us. But she has bought us some time. In her flight, the tank that has menaced us so has meet its doom. Yes, even Eden saw this. Through her own wiles, she has disabled a tank! Tell me, gentlemen, that this is not a sign!”

“I tell you, my comrades, that in my fear of her I put a gun to her brow, and she did not flinch! It was like there was no gun at all. I was a child before her, waving a toy in her face. Yes, this is what we have been pursuing so fruitlessly. The death of fear. The bringing of the light. Yes, she is one of us. I know this now. We have much to learn from her.”

Brooklyn felt a twinge of what should have been shame at his comments. What could he know of her? She was just some lady. Would it not for the hole in her brain, she might have shrank away and hid. Instead, she felt a fine-tuned discomfort, an analysis of what El Hermano was trying to do and say. Was this some fanatical militant group? An eagle scout troupe? An Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?

El Hermano Mayor produced a small sword, and stabbed something in the fire beyond her sight. Sparks flew from the fire, and doused themselves on his leather jacket. He held before them the burnt heart of an agave plant, its limbs long melted away in the flames. One of the men walked over to him with a bag, and El Hermano held the leaking heart out for him. He poured a few grains of a red inside, and the inside sizzled and hissed, and the fluid leaking out turned as red as blood.

“Sangre de agave. Brooklyn, my friend, it means blood of agave. This heart bleeds, so that ours may not.” The viscous liquid down his arm like red molasses. “Brooklyn, our new sister, you may drink first.”

The men clanged their bottles off of the rocks below as they watched her stand. She walked up to El Hermano and took the heart from him. “Just a sip,” he said to her quietly. He looked in her eyes, and she looked up. “You will not want for more. Trust me.”

She took the bleeding heart of agave in her hands and drank from it. The liquid was sugary and bitter, and took a difficult swallow. She stumbled back as the liquid hit her stomach, and the red dripped from her mouth and down her chin. A chorus of cheers grew from the crowd. El Hermano stared at her, wild-eyed, clutching the heart in his hands. A feeling welled up inside her—it felt like rage, like relief. It sublimated in her and came out in the form of a scream. A long, hoarse scream, at the gray and red shades that colored her mind and her stolen her sensibilities, of what had been done to her, of the fact that she could not know what had been done.

She sat back on the ground as the other men came for a drink from the heart. They took their sips eagerly, spitting red on the ground, pumping a fist in the air for the encouragement of the others. She grew quiet, and felt her thoughts slow. Her vision grew focused, and then unfocused, and focused again, and the hole in her head felt like it was aflame, and it ate at the the place her soul should be. She looked down at her dirty manicured fingers, and watched them wiggle at her command. She had an overwhelming sense that she had become some sort of machine, and all the constituent parts of her were nothing more than tools to aid her. Her voice, her muscles, all trainable, all useful to her ends. But for what ends?

As the furor of the meeting died down, and the dinner was eaten, and the juice had been drained from the plant, the men of the camp sat still around the low fire, trading stories and sometimes song. El Hermano Mayor sat himself on the ground next to her and sighed.

“Sorry about that, ah, display,” he said. “I have a flair for the dramatic. We are not doing anything so dangerous or so noble. We are just trying to figure out what is in our hearts and pursue it to its greatest extent. And that involves violence, sometimes.”

Brooklyn stared into the fire. He breathed heavy as he sat. “So you’re not some cult leader?”

“Cult! Ha! Maybe I am. But I’d like to think it is not nearly so crude. We can talk about what I mean by everything some other time. I could talk for an hour about what is happening. No, to put it succinctly, we are in the revenge business, not the cult business.”

“Revenge for what?” He seemed to oscillate between the theatrical and the honest. She still wanted to trust him.

He looked back out at the fire as well. “I’ll tell you sometime. It is not a story for the first meeting. Maybe the sangre has not hardened my heart so much as to be able to speak about it.”

“The blood. What is it about that stuff? I don’t even know why I had some. I guess I felt pressured. Is it dangerous? I felt so strange after.”

He laughed again, a big belly laugh that echoed off the walls of the cave and into the valley. “Ha! The blood, yes. It is some Mesoamerican tradition that had fallen out of favor. Mostly because it didn’t work. See, there were stories. About a drink favored by warriors and statesmen alike. A drink that makes you fear less, want less. Frees you from the bounds of social norms. Allows you to focus on something completely. Of course, anyone who tried it, reported that none of this happened. You just got a stomachache.”

“Well, there was a missing ingredient. It is cinnabar. Now, of course you cannot eat very much of that. You will die very quickly. But whatever it is, they have it in the hills here and in the ground, if you know where to find it. That strange red rock is what drew people to this bend in the river in the first place. When added to the, ah, aguamiel, it is called, in very trace, very safe amounts, it has all those effects and more. So, we drink it, and we try to eliminate our fear.”

“And it works?” she put her hand to the back of her head. In a moment, the events of the last two days flashed through her in reverse. Arriving at camp. Riding the burro. Waking up in the desert. Her lying on the ground before a great fire. Wait, when had that happened?

“Ah, you feel it already?” He pointed to a spot on his head. “Yes, that is the dark place in your mind where it lives. Don’t ask me how it works, I know not. Still, what you had today is not so, ah, potent. You cannot have very much at all without becoming ill, either. However, it does work. We are braver men now than we once were.”

The hole in her head. The one she’d woken up with in the desert. The world came into deeper focus as the memories fused together. The elimination of fear, he had said. She hadn’t been afraid since she’d woken up. The hole in her head, that he somehow knew about. Had she somehow taken this drug already? She decided not to tell him right away.

“So what do you do for work?” he asked. He halfheartedly put his hand on her thigh, and she took it and placed it back on the ground, smiling kindly at him. Not today, buddy.

“I do social media,” she said. “I promote various businesses to my followers, and get paid for it. I was here to do that in Terlingua and the rest of the park.”

“Ah. Interesting. I could never do such work.” As if anyone would want him to.

“It’s a good job. You know, they said I was crazy to come here.”

“Clearly things have gone very wrong for you!” he laughed that laugh again.

“Yeah. Lost myself somewhere in the desert. But the views are something else. It’s just, that’s what I was here to see. For some reason, all those photos I saw of the desert, the mountains, the canyon. I had to see it for myself. And now I have, and it’s just amazing. That much I’m happy about.”

“It is like no other place on this Earth; that much is true.”

Brooklyn looked at her fingers again, the strange things they were. “We are aliens, and this is our alien planet,” she said. “God, that’s not even the right metaphor. Whatever.”

“Like no other place, and you are like no other girl,” he continued. “Maybe you are an alien. Maybe I am. I am big and strange myself, but I am a human. I think I want to be one, still, even now. Even once I have purged the parts of myself that make me suffer. I hope I will still be able to laugh in the company of men, and keep a woman. That has not been revealed to me yet.”

“That’s awful ambitious of you,” she said. “I’ve never heard of a man that wanted to change himself that much.”

He laughed a little, and looked back at her. The fire cast his large frame huge against the wall. The shadow towered over him. “Maybe there is a lot about me that needs fixing.”

“You seem fine to me. Some self-awareness is good for a person.”

“You’re too kind to me. You don’t know me at all.”

“Nobody knows anyone.”

They sat on that conversation for a while. She wondered if she’d been overly familiar with him. He was clearly into her. The attention, she didn’t mind, but was her safety in question? A woman with a bunch of lawless men? She thought of a way she might find out.

“Say,” she said, “before you go to bed. Can I ask you for something?”

“Command me, if you like,” he said. “I won’t deny it to you.”

"Can I have a gun?”

He laughed wildly, falling back in the dirt as he did. “Sorry, sorry,” he said, getting back up. He pulled a revolver from his pocket, and placed it on her lap. He took her hand, and put it over it, still laughing to himself.

“You are a smart woman,” he said. “Kill me if I ever displease you—though I doubt you know how to shoot.”

She held it in her hand. It was an old thing, the metal decorated with faded engravings, scuffed and scratched with time. She looked in the chamber. It was unloaded.

She stood up, and tucked the gun in her waistband. “I don’t need it for shooting,” she said with a wink, and started off to bed.
