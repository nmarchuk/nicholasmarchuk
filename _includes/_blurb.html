One day, a freight train derails in the town center, causing a raging inferno that spills toxic chemicals all over the neighborhood. Connor, his friends, and everyone he knows has to move.

Kara comes to the group with a plan: they will recruit local musicians to put on a music festival where the neighborhood once stood, to convince the public that their community and way of life are worth saving. However, in a world that seems determined to leave them behind, they find that nothing comes easy.
