<h3>why you should read this book</h3>
<p>The modern age has made us into hunters of good content. When we find content, we devour it hungrily. <em>This book is content.</em> It gives you things to talk about, smile about, think about. People who read this book find that they sound more clever, more well-read, and more open-minded. To be serious, I think you'll enjoy reading it!</p>
<p>I have tried hard to think of a way to fit this book into a genre, and I have come up short in some ways. I think it depends on your perspective. In many ways, it is a humor book. There are modern cultural references. Characters misremember common phrases, make mistakes when speaking, they encounter creeps and weirdos, they laugh and joke together like old friends. I want you to be friends with the people in this book, and get to know them a little, despite their flaws.</p>
<p>The book is a bit of a romance. I don't mean in the sense that it is smut or that there are dashing business magnates based on characters from Twilight. It is a book that has things to say about love. It contains information on what it means to love one another (or not), and what is interesting, painful, or good about that. It's something I think we should all be learning about as much as we can.</p>
