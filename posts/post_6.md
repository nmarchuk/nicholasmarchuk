So, I'm no longer just a guy: I'm an author! No longer am I just someone who, if you saw him on the street, would be spat on or kicked or called names. No more am I a little bug you might crush under your shoe. I am something completely different and cooler: an artist, a cosmopolitan man of literary tastes, and most importantly *interesting*. I have written a book and you can read it, today, and I sincerely hope you do. All you have to do is click one of the big blue buttons:

For the last time: *Paint Dries as a Train Goes Off The Rails* is a novel about the demise of a fictional music scene. A group of friends navigate the aftermath of a train derailment and massive fire that destroys much of their neighborhood. When they find out that the neighborhood is set to be turned into a park, they hatch a plot to stop it. 

It's a good book, and you're probably sick of me talking about it. I'm sick of talking about it. The only thing left is for you to go read it.

## how we got here
The first chapter (which is now the second chapter) I wrote on June 21, 2023, and then the draft was not touched until fall 2024. I finished the first draft March 1, 2025, and finished revising around July 1, 2025. I write every day.

I wrote the book because I have always wanted to write books. I wrote this specific book because I wanted to write about the way I think about the world, and because that's just where the characters led me.

There is a funny acknowledgements page in the book which you should read, but I will also take a sentence here to thank Ember Nevins, the cover artist, Lesley Hocking and Helena Gill, editors, Sara A. Holm, Madelyn Margaret Battcock-Emerson, Amelia Sundman, Anastasia Marchuk, and Hannah Martuscello, for marketing and advice.

## what else? 
I did another rambling YouTube video, this time on a philosophical topic: Do you need other people?

I am almost done with a mini anthology of short stories that I'll be sharing soon. I have four stories written for it. Highlights include an alien working in a slime mine on Venus, and a man who thinks he may have melted his landlord. These stories will be 100% free to my newsletter, and I plan to add more whenever I'm not working on a book.
