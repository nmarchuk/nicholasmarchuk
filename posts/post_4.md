<a href="https://www.embernevinsart.com/" class="a inline">Ember Nevins</a> made the cover art. The physical piece of the art is mixed media, a collage with paint over it, and is quite large. The rest of the cover was assembled digitally. The title and author text is a scanned version of some vintage lettering Ember has.

I gave relative free reign to Ember for imagining the cover, and she decided to use the train derailment as inspiration after I sent her a sample to read. The original piece also included flames coming out of the wreckage, but this didn't end up reading well so those were edited out. Overall, super happy with it, and hope you guys like it too.

You may have also noticed that I launched social media for my author persona. You can find me @marchukbooks at:

* <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marchukbooks" class="a inline">Instagram</a>
* <a href="https://tiktok.com/@marchukbooks" class="a inline">TikTok</a>
* <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marchukbooks.bsky.social" class="a inline">Bluesky</a>

It's funny to be on these apps since I've been slowly stepping back from using social media too much. But I think I have the tools now to be a bit smarter about it. If you guys have ideas for something fun to post, let me know.

I am trying to commit myself to an August deadline for the book. There is a lot to figure out, so let's hope it all goes to plan. See you around!
