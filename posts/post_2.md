title: Words that I think are silly

You need to have at least two blog posts on your website, or else it's not a blog, it's just a page. So, I'm adding this here while we wait for me to start blogging for real. The book is coming along; I'm almost done with my personal round of revisions. Soon I'll be sending it to be edited and read by a couple people for feedback. The cover is coming in a few weeks as well.

**textbook**: This word makes no sense, because most books have text in them. It contrasts most nicely with 'picture books', but picture books still have text in them.

**Frenchman**: What? This one is just weird.

**cape**: There are both cool and annoying parts of the cultural identity surrounding Cape Cod. Let's knock those guys down a peg. Don't love this word, especially because 'cape' is really kind of an apocryphal word, and it's only used in the sense of the three or so places we have decided are capes, thus making it a useless descriptor. It's like how 'Bruin' is only used to describe the sports team despite ostensibly meaning 'bear'. Bad news all around!

**uptown**: I object to this word because it's almost always used in a relative sense. Also it contributes to the feeling New Yorkers have that they are the most special people in the world. This word is OUT for 2025.

**pram**: This is on the list for simply being a Britishism. You have to watch out for possible Britishisms in your daily life and eliminate them if you can. Why was 'stroller', a perfectly useful and descriptive word, not good enough for them? It also includes the bratty version of the 'a' sound (that's the linguistic term for it), which makes you sound annoying if you say it too much. Watch this space!

**colonel**: Just no.
