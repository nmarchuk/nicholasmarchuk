I think it would be funny to write a newsletter in an advice column format. So, I'm sending out this short email blast to encourage you to send me a question on my contact form. If you have a problem, I will solve it for you.

I am still trying to make the new book as good as it can possibly be. On the advice of my writer friend, I have decided the title wants to be *Blood of Agave*. We have also had some cool recent progress on the cover, and I'm excited to share that with people when things are ready. I just did another round of revisions on the book, but I still need to go back and clarify character motivations. Something I think people don't always realize is that since nothing in books are real, then you have to just come up with everything yourself, and it can very easily just not make sense because you missed something, or didn't think about it properly, or had trouble tying up the loose end... since interesting stories can be kind of contrived you have to be creative and think of good reasons why those contrived things happen. Then, you have to go back and make that consistent. That sounds boring to me! I don't like it. It's more fun to just write with no consequences.

I'm going to Norway next week. We're going to be taking a 19 hour train from Stockholm to the Arctic Circle, to the town of Narvik. We will be hanging out in this little port town and skiing. I actually have no idea what it's going to be like--we selected the destination in part because it's not a huge expensive tourist spot--but I have a feeling we're going to make the most of it either way. The town is famous mostly for a WWII-era battle that took place there, which was recently dramatized in a war movie. I'm told there is a small museum.

It was 32 degrees out today, and I honestly felt like it was spring. I felt a warm breeze on me. Maybe it's just becuase I was actually outside while the sun was up.
