title: Everything is data

This blog post is inspired by something I recently wrote to Sidney Gish. I said in my email, "I think your music has genuinely taught me something about people and helped me understand others better..." and I think that sounds like praise, which it is, but it's something that is genuinely true when it comes to my writing.

When I am at work I will often listen to music. Listening to music I like is fun, but I like music more when I start to hear the lyrics. This doesn't really always happen at all or right away, but the more I listen to a song while doing something else, I will end up actually trying to comprehend what they are saying and what they might mean. I think this is a kind of silly mental trickery because for some artists, the writing of a song is a stringing together of things that *sound* good together and are clever. For others, it's a deeply emotional process. I'm not one hundred percent sure that we are equipped to tell the difference.

The Strokes have been for a long time one of my favorite bands, but they no longer dominate my end of year playlist. Let's take a look at their smash hit song *The Adults Are Talking*:

*And don't go there 'cause you'll never return*

*I know you think of me when you think of her*

*But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard*

*To do the right thing but without recompense*

This is actually good, emotional songwriting, and it makes you think. However, Julian Casablancas is an older guy and he is a long way from being a swashbuckling cool teen in New York City. So I will venture a guess and say that this is only sixty percent of the way there emotionally. What I think Julian did was write out several sentences over a few days that he liked, and picked the ones he wanted, and put those together. I just don't believe he's telling a story--I can't really explain *why*, but it's something to do with the last two lines. They're too unrelated. It's like we got the first sentence of four different paragaphs.

Let's take a look at Sidney Gish's *Impostor Syndrome*. This one is also critically acclaimed, but didn't win a Grammy.

*Every other day I’m wondering*

*What’s a human being gotta be like?*

*What’s a way to just be competent?*

*These sweet instincts ruin my life*

I am realizing halfway through this post that it might be that I respond better to on the nose songwriting. However, I will continue to defend this position. This is one that has stuck with me for a while. I think because music is a shorter medium, it is more impressive when you can say something with twentyish words that is intelligent and relatable. I like this stanza because it really gives beginning middle and end. It really is a story type of thing, and the more I listened to her work, the more I thought about that stanza.

I like it because I am not really like Sidney Gish, and I am especially not like the person she was when she wrote that song up. The person she describes in her album *No Dogs Allowed* is very prone to self-reflection, insecure about how others perceive them, withdraws affection when she receives it, and fixates on small details about people. I am pretty flawed myself, but I would say that I do not have all those flaws.

I think these kinds of quirks actually make for good characters in books, because I know people who are in one way or another very perceptive of the world around them, and I wanted to understand that better in order to write about it. This is something I applied heavily to the leads of *Paint Dries as a Train Goes Off The Rails*. More or less everyone in the book is walking around with a stomachache. So yes, everything is computer, and everything is data. Whenever something happens I try to download it into my brain, and then it will bubble up to the surface later in the book.

# Where is the book?

Almost done! It has been a long process to get the book beta read, edited, and the cover made. I just got to see the first drafts of the final cover yesterday, and the final edits came in this weekend. So now I have to just keep tweaking it until I'm happy with it. The cover is a mixed media piece, sort of a collage with paint, and is on this huge canvas (like over a foot tall) and is incredibly impressive. I was shocked when I saw it, because the book is only going to be 6"x9" or around there. Once I start to scale up my social media presence I will be showing it off as much as I can. The last thing I need to do is have an author photo taken of myself. Unfortunately this is the one thing that has proven weirdly difficult.

Have a good summer!
