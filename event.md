*72 Joy St, Somerville / September 13, 2025 / 7 - 11pm*

Come celebrate the release of my debut novel with an evening of **festivities**. There will be appetizers and non-alcoholic drinks for your enjoyment, as well as an **assortment** of statesmen, fools, debutantes, and **thought leaders**. The event will be at Life Drawing Boston in Somerville.

Payment at the door will be **$5**, and paperbacks will be available for purchase. Merchandise will be on sale.

*The following things shall occur:*
- An appearance by the **Dirty Water Brass Band,** a 'movable block party' known for its **raucous** conduct. And yes, I'll be playing trombone with them.
- *(unconfirmed)* An appearance by the surviving members of **Halfshell**, the last rock band to ever come out of Dover, New Hampshire.
