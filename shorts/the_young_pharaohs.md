“C’mon, Elizabeth! Don’t you want to go to the ballgame with your old man?” her father said, making an exaggerated swinging motion. “Crack! Goes the bat,” he continued, “going, going, gone! The crowd goes wild. And you’re next to me, having a soda. I’m having a beer. How can you not be romantic about baseball?”

Elizabeth shrugged and scrolled on her phone. “I don’t know, Dad. I guess I just don’t love baseball much.”

He sighed. “You know I’ll always love you. You’ll always be my little girl—but when you say things like that, it really hurts me and your mother. You know that.”

Her mom chimed in from the sink, where she was working through some dishes. “Honey, everyone loves baseball,” she said. “Don’t you want to make your father happy and go to the ballgame? You could have fun.”

“I went to the game on Friday,” she replied. “It went to sixteen innings, and we stayed through all that, too. That’s enough baseball for me.”

“It was a beautiful game! Remember when Sale started tipping his pitches? I caught it as soon as the Yankees did. I pointed it right out, I did, because I know baseball. I know these things. What could be better than that? Baseball is magic. And we can have that again today.”

“The game ended one to zero! The ghost runner stole home because the pitcher threw it in the dirt twice. Some kind of game that was.”

“So you do pay attention!” her father said. “Seems like you might be a fan after all!”

“I’m not going,” Elizabeth said, standing up and putting her ballcap on—a 2011 Bruins Stanley Cup Champions hat. She ensured that she had her wallet and her keys and walked out the front door without another word.

She drove her blue-gray 2009 Hyundai Sonata with the windows down and her hand out the window. She had heard once that there used to be bugs when you drove. The bugs would fly and hit all over the windshield and the grille of the car and get stuck. Not anymore, her father had told her. Not anymore. She wore the driving sunglasses her grandmother had given her, big bug-eyed ones. Sometimes she forgot she was wearing them, and would get weird looks at the Seven Eleven on the days when she stopped in to pay for gas and a Slim Jim.

She eased the car onto the main road. At the edge of some old hay field was a billboard bearing a photo of Dustin Pedroia hitting a ball right in the center of his bat. It made no attempt to advertise any product beyond baseball itself, and perhaps the mythology of it all. Of course, he’d been dead for ten years, but everyone here loved him the same. The road wound around a dozen dusty ballparks, where groups of youths with team names like “The Barking Crab”, “Amazon”, or “Waste Management” used their limp arms to hit balls off tees into red clay dirt, to the delight of crowds of adoring parents and grandparents.

Elizabeth drove to the edge of town, past the ballfields, to the industrial park, where single floor cinderblock buildings and adult film stores sat between rusted train tracks and piles of trash. One of these lots had a crooked pair of uprights at either end, forming the only football field in town. It was a dirt field, besides for the patches of crabgrass that grew on those parts of it that were less worn from gameplay. The scoreboard hung in the air broken and decaying—it hadn’t worked for twenty years. She parked her car at the edge of the end zone and moved the rearview mirror to look at herself. She took her sunglasses off, and fixed her hair.

A girl about her age got in the passenger seat of the car and gave her a firm kiss on the cheek. Elizabeth tried to act normal. “Hey, Gwen,” she said. “How was the game?”

Gwen was dirty from head to toe, her knee-high white socks stained brown, patches of dirt and scratches on her face and arms. “Not bad,” she said.

“Aren’t you the kicker?” Elizabeth asked. “How’d you get so dirty today?”

“Got in a fight,” Gwen said, moving the mirror to look at herself. “I’ll be alright. How do I look?”

“You look like shit,” she said, and the two of them laughed.

“How did you get away from your parents? Aren’t the Sox playing today?”

“I just said I wasn’t going.”

“That’s my girl,” Gwen said. “You just have to stand up for yourself.”

“Yeah, maybe,” Elizabeth said, starting the car. “Where we going?”

“Can we just get some food?”

Elizabeth needed no convincing, and reversed out of the dirt lot. A car full of teenagers came to a screeching halt next to them. The driver, wearing a baseball uniform, threw a carton of eggs at her car. They exploded in a film of yellow and white goo on the passenger side window.

“Why don’t you play baseball, you freaks?” he shouted, his friends laughing. The car sped away.

Elizabeth hugged Gwen and the two didn’t say more about it. They headed to the car wash that had an attached taqueria. It was as good a place as any. Elizabeth drove out of the car wash and forward into a parking spot. The restaurant was the sort of place that always had the blinds drawn, the sort of place where the exterior was dirty and the doors were always shut and you were never quite sure if it was open. It would be open, though, when she opened the door. It was a cramped little place, a five-seat bar in the back with no bartender, a pinball machine on one wall between two booths, and then a couple two-tops on the other side. There were dark beige faux-wood tables with green trim, and black metal chairs on an unfinished poured concrete floor.

There were two construction workers at the bar in their bright yellow work shirts, each having a cup filled with some brown liquor over crushed ice. “Come on,” one said to the other, “one more last one.”

They sat on the same side at a booth and helped themselves to the QR code menus. “What you getting?” Elizabeth asked.

“Probably plantains again.”

“Come on, you need real food. You just had a whole football game.”

“I’m not hungry.”

“Whatever,” Elizabeth said. The one front of house person in the restaurant, a middle aged man who called himself Chico, came over to the table and sat across from them with his little notebook.

“Did things work out for you?” he asked, looking up at Gwen.

“I’m not sure what that means,” Gwen said, not looking up from the menu.

“You know,” Chico said. “Quitting softball.”

“Oh, that was a while ago. They’re still getting used to the idea, but I haven’t been back.”

“That’s good,” he said, “and I’m guessing you’re looking for plantains? Also, why are you so dirty, my friend? What’s going on with you? Does your friend Elizabeth not tell you to keep yourself clean?”

Gwen put her phone flat on the table and looked at Elizabeth. “Yeah, I don’t know about her,” she said. “You know I’ve been playing gridiron football?”

“Football!” Chico laughed. “Okay. American football. Well, I can’t say I know much about that.”

“I’m supportive,” Elizabeth said. “Can I have the chicken burrito, Jalisco style?”

“Certainly,” Chico said, ripping the ticket off and putting the notebook in the pocket of his apron. “Should be about ten minutes.”

Gwen sighed and leaned her head against the back of the booth. “You sure you didn’t get a concussion or something?” Elizabeth asked.

“I’m fine.”

“You seem out of it.”

“I said I’m fine. I got beat up, that’s all. It’s part of the game. If I wanted to be lectured I’d just go home.”

The construction workers finally closed their tab and left. “Did you hear they’re going to trade Messi again?” one said.

“He doesn’t have it anymore,” the other replied between hiccups. “He’s older than me, and look how I am.”

“Don’t think it’s the age that caught up with you, dude. It might be the beers.”

“Oh, shut up,” the worker said, holding the door open to let his only friend out.

Little was said over lunch. They preferred to not talk all the time—hanging out could be enough. After getting in the car to leave, they found the exit of the taqueria’s driveway suddenly blocked by a procession of yellow school buses.

“Shit, I totally forgot about this,” Elizabeth said. Teenagers in baseball uniforms hung out of the windows, hooting and hollering and waving their ballcaps at the sparse crowds of people on the street that had no sidewalks. Behind them, two firetrucks, several police cars, an ambulance, a mail truck, and two dozen SUVs with adoring parents.

“What is it?” Gwen asked. She hadn’t looked up from her phone.

“It’s the high school team. They’re playing against Eastchester today.”

“Oh, yeah. Well, good for them I guess. Fuck those guys,” Gwen said. If there was any middle ground between girls like Gwen and Elizabeth and the baseball-loving denizens of their little town, it was the bad blood between their team, the Worcestershire Young Pharaohs, and the Eastchester Raging Indians. If not only because of their outmoded team name and mascot, because the people of Eastchester seemed to love baseball even more than the people of Worcestershire. This fact alone drove the townsfolk mad with jealousy.

Marking the end of the procession was the colossal ten-foot paper sculpture of a mummy carried on the short bed of a Ford F-250 Super Duty with the Admiral Blue interior color, Power Adjustable Steering Column, 1-year Ford Security Package, and Avalanche exterior finish color. The strands of paper covering the sculpture waved in the wind and broke off every few seconds, leaving a trail of thin paper on the road behind it. It was rumored that the pharaoh had to be repaired every time it went out for a drive. There was talk of investing in a copper statue.

“Yeah, I’m not waiting,” Elizabeth said, and peeled out of the parking lot to follow the end of the parade. She quickly found that her blue-gray 2009 Hyundai Sonata was known around town though. It wasn’t a lot like the other vehicles people drove, but she thought of herself as a bit of a gearhead. Some of the townspeople jeered at them and gave them dirty looks as they followed behind the pharaoh, and others took it as a sign to pack up their lawn chairs and leave.

The parade soon ended, and the truck carrying the effigy turned off and started driving back to the high school where it was stored. Not sure of anything else to do, and not wanting to go back home just yet, Elizabeth followed the truck at a distance until it reached the parking lot of the high school. There was a small crew of dads in the parking lot of the school ready to receive the truck. They flipped open the bed and leaned a long ramp against it, and made short work of walking the paper pharaoh down it and parking it against the wall of the school. Then, some other men threw a large tarp over the top of the pharaoh to protect it from the elements. Upon observing all this, Gwen glanced up from her phone and looked at Elizabeth. She chewed on a piece of gum that Elizabeth hadn’t seen her put in, and smiled at her.

Under cover of darkness, the teenage couple approached the school. Gwen, wearing a scarf over her mouth, took to the side of the gym with a can of red spray paint. She wrote, “INDIANS KILL PHARAOHS”, in red block letters—such was the unofficial slogan of the rival baseball team. Elizabeth approached the pharaoh and untied the bungee cords that tied it down and removed the tarp. The pharaoh had glass eyes bulging out of its paper body, and those eyes reflected the orange street lights. She produced a rag soaked in alcohol and found that it lit easily. She laid it at the feet of the mummy, like some final offering for it to carry back to the land of the dead, and ran back to the car.

Gwen was close on her heels, and Elizabeth did not waste a moment looking back as she drove off. She didn’t have to: the dashboard and mirrors lit up in a bright orange and yellow, and sparkling strands of burning paper flew through the air crackling and popping. She put her hand on Gwen’s thigh and steered that old car out onto the main road and into the night of twinkling streetlights and darkness overhead.

Gwen and Elizabeth stood on the broken sidewalk and watched the column of young baseball players march down the road. Bats laid over their shoulders, gloves in hand, they marched with stone-faced ferocity down the center of the six-lane road. Behind them was the metal skeleton of the pharaoh, towering over them all on the back of the huge truck. Above, gray clouds floated like spaceships heading to an enemy planet.

Behind her, Elizabeth’s dad had his hand on her mom’s shoulder, staring out at the scene in front of them, his face fallen. “They’re just kids,” he said, “and we’re sending them off to war? It doesn’t make sense.”

Elizabeth turned and walked past her dad towards the house. “All over some petty vandalism,” she said.

“Yeah,” he said. “They’re trying to make this bigger than baseball. That’s just wrong. It’s about the game, and the love we have for it, the ancient science of how to play it. We shouldn’t be—“

“That’s okay, honey,” her mom said, rubbing his chest. “Let’s just go inside.”

Gwen followed the group in, and sat with Elizabeth on the couch. There was a rerun of some old sitcom on the television and the two watched it quietly. “Hey kids, can I get you anything?” her father asked from the kitchen.

“Do we still have that bag of chips?” Elizabeth asked. “Thank you.”

Gwen leaned close to Elizabeth. “I thought you said he was homophobic?” she asked.

“Dude, I didn’t say that. Don’t say things like that. I said he doesn’t like that we quit softball.”

“Oh. Alright. I can deal with that.” She eased up.

The bag of chips came flying across the room and hit Elizabeth in the head. She and her dad laughed at the insult. She took a chip from the bag and threw it back at her dad. He caught it behind his back, to her surprise. “See? I told you I was a shortstop,” he said.

“Whatever,” Elizabeth added.

She turned her attention to the television. Jerry Seinfeld was trying to work up the courage to kiss a female baseball umpire. Weird, she thought. She didn’t remember that episode.
