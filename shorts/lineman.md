title: Lineman

Bobby sat on the porch of his second floor apartment out near the trees and the electrical wires. They were black and tied together, a dozen connections brimming with some unknown power that bled and buzzed when it rained and sagged when it snowed. He would have loved a cigarette but he’d quit a dozen and change years ago. His sitting time was then disturbed by the sound of a worker shimmying up the telephone pole. He had a strap about his waist that he wasted no time in edging up the pole, which he hugged with his knees when the strap was moving. The worker had a white hard hat and an old orange shirt on. Bobby was excited that the worker would visit him on such a dreary hot evening like this.

When he reached the top of the pole, Bobby called him. “Say, what you doing up there?”


The man’s face snarled some. “Only what I have to.” He began to pull tools off his belt and organize them in some fashion.

“Need any help?” Bobby asked, cackling to himself. He took a sip of his diet soda.

“Not that I checked,” he said.

“Say, what’s that job of yours? What’s someone like you called? I never thought about that before.”

“Lineman,” said the lineman.

“And you got your, eh, your conduits and your diodes and all that to fix?”

“Let me work, alright?” the lineman began unscrewing a box from the post.

“Work all you like,” Bobby said. “Won’t do you a bit of good being so sour with me.”
The worker grunted and continued messing with the box. He was digging around inside of it, finding and tweaking components inside, occasionally applying force with his pliers. He focused on his work with anger and precision, like the box were some evil device that he sought to tame with precise magic. The sky was graying around him, steel and lifeless, betraying nothing.

“Storm’s rollin’ in,” said Bobby. “I best get inside.”

“Ain’t no storm.”

“I’m old enough to know.”

“Not old enough to shut your trap.”

“Why are you so goddamned sour with me? Can’t have a bit of talk with an old man. Makes not a bit of sense why you could dislike me for all that I’ve done to you—which is nothing.”

The lineman sighed and put his tool down. “I touch the wrong bit of metal and I’m a dead man. I drop this box and I lose my job. I’m not gettin’ paid to have conversations of any kind. Only thing I want to talk to is the box here. That’s what matters.”

“Have it your way,” Bobby said, folding up his beach chair and tucking it under his arm. “I won’t have more words with you.”

“Have as many words as you like,” said the lineman. “Just do it by yourself.”

Bobby was no stranger to that. He’d been by himself most all the time. He into his kitchen where the cabinets were a neutral wood color and the floors were that same color. The walls were white, the doors white, the doorknobs white. Those were the two textures his landlord had deemed Bobby to be worthy of.

That was why Bobby had picked out a white polyethylene barrel to store the body of his landlord. The barrel was soundly constructed and did not smell at all. Nobody as of yet knew that the sucker was gone. Bobby had never set out to be a killer. It was more that he always had felt that there was a screw loose inside of him and that screw had just turned one day. Nobody had come calling for the man yet, so he figured he was in the clear.

It was a stupid story, all told. He was sitting watching some daytime television and the man had let himself in the front door. “Bobby,” he’d said. “I’m here for that light.”

Bobby had a hard time being up on a ladder, so he’d have the landlord send a man to switch them out. Well, that day Bobby had set up by the TV and was outside of himself. Something in the news stirred him up. He was sure that this man who’d let himself in was not the maintenance man or the landlord or whoever but a maniac of some kind who sought to rob him or worse. He lay in wait with his old machete by the threshold of his living room and matters progressed when the old landlord stepped within his sight. Gosh, he looked surprised then.

He had some corn puffs, the white barrel bathed in the yellow sink light staring back at him. He realized he wasn’t all that hungry, just eating ‘cause he had lost his outside time and needed something to occupy himself with. The window sat to his right and provided a view of just the gray shingles of the neighboring triplex and a sliver of gray sky with a black bird flying over. He couldn’t shake the feeling that rain was afoot.

He went back out with his soda to talk to the lineman. He was still at work, having moved on from the box to some other thing. He had a mess of straps about him, tools hanging off, himself tangled in an uncomfortable-looking manner among the black wires that strung between the houses.

“Lineman,” said Bobby. “Say, don’t you think it looks like rain?”

“Sure does,” said the lineman, looking up at the sky. He went back to work, this time redoubling his effort.

“Then why are you still up there?”

The lineman didn’t answer for a moment. He worked steadily until some metal piece flew free of the pole and fell to the sidewalk. “Dunno. Guess I have a screw loose in me. Happens I feel like getting the job done anyway, rain or not.”

“That don’t make sense.”

“No, you’re not making any sense,” the lineman said, waving his tool at Bobby. “It rains here most days out of the month this time of year. Does the line burst into flames each time that happens? There is a way that the electricity can live in a stable way, even when it is wet out. Same goes for me. There’s a way I can be here.”

“Say, can you stand the lightning when it comes?”

“Ain’t no lightning.”

“You said that about the rain.”

“Maybe I don’t mind lightning.”


“Now, I don’t know a lot about electricity,” said Bobby. “But I do know that the lightning if it did come would strike you off this Earth.”

“Like I said. Maybe I got a screw loose.”

“Loose or not, I’d call you dumb for that.” The lineman didn’t reply. “You want to stay up there when I’m telling you it looks lightning out? I was right about the rain, I’ll be right about this just as much. You’re wasting some precious thing. You got a lot to live for, lineman. You got time left still to screw yourself and end up like me. It was fun, along the way. I loved a lot. You know I did. I played a lot. I did all sorts of things and did them my way and it didn’t do me a lick of good, but I did it. That all takes time, and you ain’t had time yet. Are you hearing me? I’m not asking you to be alright. Just asking you to get down from there.”

The lineman kept working. “What sorts of things did you get up to?” he asked. His tone was a small amount interested.

“I stole a plane,” said Bobby. That much was true.

“You?”

“I stole it, I did, lineman. Was all due to the touch of this woman. I’d say if you measured the river that flowed from the Garden of Eden to that corner of Nevada then you would reckon she was made from it. Her papa owned a plane, a small engine thing, one of those Cessna toys you used to be able to tool around in. Well, happens I was an aircraft mechanic at the time. Never did fly a plane, but I knew my way around, sure did. Well, he’d bring her around for just some patterns around the airport, nothing crazy—said he was too scared to take her over the mountains, said it was a risk. And yet he’d taken the same trip with his golf buddies a couple times a year. She resented him for it.”

“And so you stole her the plane?” The lineman was enthralled, having stopped his work. Gosh, it did sure look like rain. “Tell me the story.”

“If you get down from there we can sit out on the porch and I’ll tell you it all.”
The lineman looked up at the thundercloud forming above and spat. “Alright, then.” He waved to an unseen coworker waiting below and began to unstrap himself from his hold. “Once I call it in, if it don’t let up in thirty minutes we pack up and leave.”

“Sure thing. In my assessment it might let up.”

A short time later they sat on folding chairs on either side of the porch. “So go on,” the lineman said. “Since you talked all crazy like to me and made me waste a day.”

“Well, where was I?” Bobby said, scratching his chin. “Well, I told her that if she could get the keys for me then I’d take her as far as she liked. Oh, she could have kissed me then, but she didn’t. She gets me the keys the next morning—shop was closed on Sundays—and I fire the thing up. Old man had let me ride along with him a couple times—that’s how I got soft on the girl anyway—and I just imagined I was him. Old man pilot. Hit this button, hit that, check the flaps. No tower at that little airport, it was some private job. And soon we were in the air.”

“Just like that, huh?” said the lineman. “You just took off?”

“Easy as can be.” Bobby made a flying motion with his hand. “Whoosh.”

“How’d you get the plane down?”

“Don’t rush me, lineman. Free as a bird I was in the sky there. I almost didn’t think of the girl. It was like no other feeling, to be up above it all like that, floating on nothing at all. Someone came in over the radio, so I shut it off. One hand on that yolk and one on her thigh.  Wow, there was nothing like that. I told myself I’d fly to the end of the world, I did. I could barely breathe then. Haven’t you ever felt like that? Just flying above it all?”

The lineman laughed. “Maybe on the line some days. If I have to go high enough. A 500 kilovolt line in the middle of nowhere with the hot stick in my hands. Feels more like a perched bird then a flying one, though.”

“Yeah, well. We kept on like that for a while, flying, we were. I showed her the mountains and we turned back as it was getting late. You should have seen the sun set then. It’s bigger when you’re up there. And the gold is all you see.”

“And then you landed the plane?”

“Remember how I said I never flew one before? I knew how to reduce the angle, set the flaps, whatever, I’d heard it before. Just like the movies. I know it was a dumb thing all around—but I really thought I could do it. I just was never one for a strong sense of speed and direction, and that sense gets worse in a plane. So I find the airport, and I start descending. And we go down, down, further down, and I’m realizing I have no idea how to slow the goddamned plane.”

“Damn,” said the lineman. It had started to rain, and rain hard, yet the porch roof kept most of it out. The thundercloud above was beginning to look angry, but had not made a noise yet.

“Well, I set the plane down on the spot it was supposed to, but it was too fast. It was just too much. I slammed the thing down and the gear buckled and the body of the plane went right down on the tar, and we probably bounced six feet in the air off that thing. Skidded half a mile as I could figure it. The plane belonged to the insurance company at that point.”

“Did the girl live? Did you end up with her?” the lineman asked.

Bobby looked at him and took a sip of his soda. “What a dumb question. What a stupid, dumb question, asked by a guy who doesn’t see what happens to a man when he takes more than is his lot in life. The girl lived, she did. I guess they’d figured out by the fact that I hadn’t made any radio communication that something had happened with the plane, and they’d called the old man to ask if he was up there or not or if it was someone else. He says no, that’s not me, comes screaming into the airport, sees the whole affair of the landing. I thought he might kill me right there.”

The lineman shook his head. “You’re lucky you didn’t kill her,” he said. “That’s one crazy story.”

“Lucky, yeah. I was ever so lucky, then. That’s not the whole story. I know the old man is a minute away from calling the cops, and so I have to skip the girl and skip town as soon as I can. Back in the day, something happened, you could just walk away. Move a few states over pick a new name and pretend that you weren’t a screwup. But I thought, somehow, I could ask that girl to come with me. So I lay low the next day, and in the night I come to her house with some flowers. I figure old man has gone to bed already.”

“Happens that just as I come I see an ambulance in the driveway. A couple sorry paramedics are taking a stretcher out of the front door, and there she is, dead as the day before she was born. All peaceful like. And I run to the ambulance and grab the man, and I ask what had happened, and why he wasn’t giving her CPR or doing anything for her. She was fine just yesterday, after all. He says she had a massive brain hemorrhage and had been dead for an hour when the old man found her sitting in bed. The book she was reading had fell on her face open to the second to the last page. Said sometimes it just happens.”

“Oh, that’s horrible,” said the lineman. “I can’t believe that. She just dies?”

“She just dies.”

“Can’t that happen if you hit your head good?”

“I had that inkling, I did. But I’ve never thought to look it up,” Bobby said. “Wanna know why? Since I knew I was going to blame myself either way I didn’t think it’d matter.”

“So that’s what screwed you up so much?” the lineman asked.

“How screwed up can you be if you get to be old?” Bobby said, tapping his fingers on the chair arm. “Listen, can you help me with something?”

“I really should be off. I don’t get paid to sit on the porch and chat.”

“It’ll be two seconds. You’re stronger than I, I just need someone to move something for me.”


The lineman laughed at himself. “Alright old man. Just ‘cause of that weird old story you told me. What you need?”

“Just this barrel,” Bobby said, ushering him inside. They walked to the kitchen. “See the barrel? I just need it taken down to the basement. No good to have it in the kitchen taking up space.”

The lineman scratched his head, his tool belt jangling as he did so. “There’s no barrel.”

“What do you mean there’s no barrel?”

“There’s no goddamned barrel in your kitchen. I don’t know what you mean.”

Bobby blinked a few times and looked really closely around the kitchen. He was sure he’d had a white barrel with a man in it. He’d looked at the thing five minutes ago. He remembered killing the man, stuffing him in it, filling the thing with acid, watching it dissolve. And yet the more he looked the more he realized there was no barrel.

He laughed, cackling and low pitched, and set his hand on the lineman’s arm, steadying himself. He wasn’t a killer after all, just someone who imagined things. That he could deal with being. “You’re right, kid,” he said. “I forget these things. My nephew must have moved the barrel for me yesterday—he helps around the house.”

The lineman rolled his eyes and made for the exit, thanking Bobby for his time. The rain had not let up, so Bobby went back out to the porch to watch him pack his things into the street. Thunder came once in the distance, and the wind and the rain picked up, and things grew quiet. Then, the deafening crash of lightning issued from the sky and struck the telephone pole that was just before him on the sidewalk, the heat nearly burning Bobby as it did. It sent current down the wires, sending sparks flying out of the boxes six poles in each direction, covering the ground in electricity. Time slowed until the reverberation of the strike signaled the end of the affair, returning the sound of rain and wind to the world.

He ran downstairs to see what had happened. The telephone pole had blackened and nearly split, and the side of his house was black as well. He realized he had narrowly escaped the strike himself. He looked forward to the street and saw the lineman lying dead on the ground, a burn searing directly across his chest. He ran over, sobbing and rapidly getting soaked from the rain, and started chest compressions on the lineman. He worked and worked, but it was not something he knew how to do.

“Stay with me, lineman,” he said. “Don’t you go flying yet. There’s nothing up there but sky.”
