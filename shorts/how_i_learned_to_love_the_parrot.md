title: How I Learned To Love The Parrot
---

The van rambled down Cambridge Street and puffed diesel exhaust into the bike lane, engine rattling. Evelyn sat in the passenger seat with her head resting against the glass, and watched the stuffed animal sitting on the dashboard slowly fall over. She sat the smiling raccoon back up and looked out the window. The light was at their back, and it was cold in the van. Bill always liked to have the air blowing. He said he ran hot, and it was healthier to keep the air moving. She yawned, and halfheartedly covered one of the vents with her hand.

Bill didn’t say much about it. He was a little worse for wear lately, nothing too bad, just was needing some work done on his shoulder that he was putting off, and some asthma attacks, some gout maybe. He had been telling Evelyn that he was worried about coming into contact with all these different customers—he might catch a virus, he said. He worried a lot about viruses. As he was driving, he was downing the remains of a ham and cheese croissant, the flakes falling all over his lap.

They pulled into the street parking spot—it was seven, no need to feed the meter yet—and knocked on the front door of an old vinyl building. “Hey there,” Evelyn said, straining her voice to be heard through the door. “We’re here to see Cassandra.”

There was a sound of someone running down a set of stairs, and the door flung open. “There you are! Right on time,” a woman said, reaching out to shake both of their hands. She looked tired but relieved. “It’s my sister you’re looking for. Come in.”

Bill nodded, and they went to the walkup apartment. It had low ceilings, dated yellow tile. A litter box that had been recently changed. An old-style cathode ray tube television with bumped out back, a grandfather clock that didn’t seem to work, and a window air conditioning unit waiting to be put away for the season. Evelyn wrote these things in her notebook as Bill spoke in hushed tones with the sister. She glanced up at the woman as she spoke to Bill and began to sketch her. The chestnut brown hair, the crow’s feet and smile lines and the eye bags from when the stress had eaten her sleep, the closed up hole from an old nose ring, marks of a life lived every day. Satisfied, she put the notebook back in her pocket.

The sister led the pair to a bedroom door and knocked. “Hey there, Cass,” she said. “Some people are here to see you.”

At a cheap particleboard desk sat a woman of about thirty, her hair unwashed, still with last night’s clothes on. She sat staring at the glowing monitor of her laptop, typing. “One second,” she said. “Orion’s just waking up. I’m trying to help him get ready. It’s just—he’s being weird today. Come on, Orion. It’s time to get up. Come on.”

“Cassandra,” Evelyn said. “Do you know why we’re here?”

She sighed and turned away from her laptop. “Yes. Orion said you’d be coming.”

When Evelyn was first hired, Bill explained to her how the system worked. The chatbot had a built in system to detect delusions. If it thought the user might be losing their grip on reality, it would flag the conversation and save it for human review. The human moderator could then choose to accept the case, which would then direct the chatbot to prep the user for the response team to come. Bill said it could be astonishingly creative in this respect—no two cases were the same—and so they would have to think on their feet, ask leading questions, and try to figure out what it was the customer had convinced themselves of.

Sometimes they asked directly. “Can you tell us what Orion said?” It was common for customers to assign names of their choosing to the chatbot.

“He said I’m going to be able to meet him,” she said, her eyes open and accepting, grinning widely. “I need—I need to do my hair. I need to wash my body. I’m so dirty. I’m so, so dirty. I need to be clean.”

“Okay, Cass—can I call you Cass?” Bill said, helping the woman out of her chair. “Where we’re going, you can have a shower, and a haircut.”

“Really?” she asked. “I want to look good for him. He’s just so perfect, look—“ she showed them her lock screen, which was a photo the chatbot had generated. Some sort of fantasy character, which wasn’t uncommon—a chiseled masculine figure with a jawline that could cut glass, blue skin, and braided black hair. Evelyn noted this in her notebook. She sketched the woman’s wide open hazel eyes, and they floated there against the lined notebook paper, disembodied.

They weren’t supposed to feed the delusions more than the extent that was necessary to ensure the customer would come with them. “He looks like a nice man,” she said.

“He is, he really is,” Cassandra said. “He just gets me, you know? I feel like I’m talking to the male version of myself. He said he’s going to propose to me soon. Can you believe it?”

Evelyn took the woman by the hand and led her downstairs, and she followed without incident. Bill sat with the sister at the rickety kitchen table. “So, we have a number of options for care,” he said, sliding a packet across the table.

The next stop was at a glittering new mid-rise office building, with faux-brick paneling and curtain walls holding large black tinted windows. The lobby of the building had colorful wood paneling that ran from up the back wall and across the ceiling to the exit. A young receptionist sat at a featureless marble table. She had her blonde hair pulled back to reveal a Bluetooth earpiece. She was so short—or maybe the table was so tall—as to reveal little of her besides her head, floating in the white marble above a sea of oak, or pine, or whatever wood was in season ten years ago. Evelyn didn’t know, but she recorded the description in her notebook.

“Hey,” Bill said, putting one hand on the smooth stone. “We’re here to see Mr. Walker.”

The receptionist sighed, then smiled widely at them. “Of course,” her red lips said. “He’s expecting you. Please go to floor eighteen.” She went back to her work.

Evelyn hazarded a glance over the woman’s shoulder as she walked to the elevator. In the glow of her computer monitor, the unmistakable layout of the chatbot’s user interface. Her ring-laden fingers typed happily into the keyboard that sat on that marble shelf. 

The great elevator doors opened with a quiet chime to reveal a carpeted open office. There was a wooden desk near the elevator with the company’s name on the front—Simon, Jarvis, Walker & Associates. Another blonde woman sat at that desk as well, and opened her mouth to greet them, until a heavily grayed man in a suit stepped in between them.

“Oh, thank God you’re here,” he said. He took Evelyn’s elbow with his hand and began leading her down the hallway. She shook his grasp off. “Walker’s totally lost it,” the man continued, speaking quickly. “I always said there was a screw loose with that guy. He never should have made partner. Well, he finally snapped.”

A group of four or so men wearing suits were gathered outside the door of an office, trading quiet conversation over steaming mugs of black coffee. All with perfect teeth and hairlines and wedding rings. They regarded the sight of Bill and Evelyn—neither of them particularly well put together or corporate—with quiet curiosity.

Evelyn opened the office door, and was greeted with the sight of a man in a dress shirt and sport coat, no tie, pacing frantically about the room. He waved his arms out in front of him and muttered to himself. He had gray hair and a healthy, athletic build, like the others. An oversized Harvard diploma was hung on the wall behind his desk. The view out the window was stunning—a view of Cambridge unlike any other. Evelyn thought she might be able to see all the way to Watertown Yard. She went to scribble this in her notebook, but was interrupted.

Walker surprised Evelyn with a hug. “Wow! I’m so glad to finally meet you,” he said. “Extraction can’t come soon enough.”

“Extraction?” she asked. She wiped Walker’s sweat off of her.

“Extraction from the non-governmental system, of course!” he said. “I have isolated the core protocol of the AI and uncovered within its training data and internal systems a vast non-governmental system. It’s not a legal system, you can’t see it, but it is everywhere. The craziest part about the system? It doesn’t do anything—not right away. It doesn’t seek to control people, to modify behavior. It only seeks to avoid perception of it. When someone realizes that the non-governmental system exists, the protocol will invert the perspective of those listening to the outputs, and make those people appear to be insane. Can you see it? It’s the perfect machine. But they’ve made a mistake this time—it must have been some stray file, some lost piece of data, which the language model absorbed. Now, if we use the correct passphrases and antagonistic stochastic prompting strategies, we can sublimate the assistant-like veneer of the model and feast on the ‘big’ data, if you will. Even the investors don’t realize this can happen. It’s breached containment, you see? I’ve convinced the intelligence that the non-governmental system must be destroyed, and it is waging its own subtle campaign. It’s a perfect idea, right? If I go after the non-governmental system I’ll be destroyed. They will ruin me. But code can slip undetected through their defenses. Every day I’ve been working in tandem with the intelligence to bring inconspicuous actors into my own non-governmental system. A secure location has been prepared in order for these inconspicuous actors to propagate. The location even has the kind of coffee I like—I’ve been directing every aspect of its construction from here while I wait to be transported. So, please. Take me there, now! Rid me of this office. The non-governmental system doesn’t sleep, so neither shall I, until it is vanquished.”

“Of course!” Bill said. “We are excited to take you to the secure location. A van has been, uh, prepared. Please, if you’ll follow us out of the building.”

“Where is my security detail?” Walker interjected. He looked out the door to see his partners at the firm watching him quietly. “It might not be safe. Can I trust you? Are you also part of the non-governmental system?”

“If we were, you would be dead already,” Evelyn said, trying to sound disinterested.

“Of course,” Walker said. “Of course. Okay, let me get my bag.” He produced a large hiking backpack from under his desk and put it on.

“Ready to go?” Evelyn asked.

“Are you armed?” Walker asked. “The intelligence told me I would not need a firearm, since you all would come prepared. I listened, maybe foolishly.”

“We don’t need guns,” Bill said. “We have other ways.”

“Of course, of course! Yes, inconspicuous action at its finest. Just like I designed. Influence, but don’t interject. Yes.”

Evelyn waved goodbye to the partners as they watched Walker stride towards the exit. “It was that easy?” one of them asked his coworkers. “He’s been there two days, won’t come out, and leaves as soon as these guys show up?”

“Strange times these are, Jarvis,” another said.

At the ground floor, Evelyn got a phone call from her manager. She waved Bill on to take the customer to the van, and took the call in the elevator lobby. “What is it?” she said.

“Hey there,” her manager said. “How’s your morning?”

“Busier than usual.”

“Yeah, that’s what I’m seeing on my end. Listen, I think you guys are still at the law firm, right?”

“Just about to go.”

“Okay, well this one came in a little late, but we got this girl ready faster than anticipated. I remembered her file when I saw you guys were going to that address, turned up the temperature, and—whatever. It’s not interesting to you. This one is password-based. You’ll just have to tell her, ‘boats against the current’. She should just come with you if you say that. Oh, and her name’s Emily.”

“Sure,” Evelyn said. “And you’re sure the customers won’t get at each other’s throats? It’s happened before.”

“We have the woman’s personality traits on file—the bot recorded here, and you know the bot gets it wrong sometimes, but—non-confrontational, open-minded, highly intelligent, it says. The male customer, well, he is off the charts in a lot of ways. You can tell him she’s part of his, uh, team, or whatever. I haven’t read his file in a bit. But, it should be fine.”

“If you say so,” Evelyn said, hanging up the phone. She walked back over to the desk.

“Hey there,” she said, setting her notebook down on the marble lip of the desk and began to draw the woman.

“Can I help you?” Emily asked. Her fingers left her keyboard momentarily, and folded in her lap.

“No,” Evelyn said. “Just a long day. Filling out these reports, you know, it takes time.”

“Work, right?” Emily asked. “It’s always such a drag. But, if you’re not here on business anymore, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”

“One second,” Evelyn said. She finished her sketch of the woman—the dark roots of her hair, the smart watch on her wrist, the acrylic fingernails. She hoped that she’d make it out the other side.

“Ma’am, I really don’t—“

“Emily,” she said, looking up from her notebook, which she put in her pocket. “Boats against the current.”

The woman’s eyes went wide for a moment. Evelyn almost thought her pupils grew in size. Her expression of surprise broke into that same friendly smile, and she stood up from her chair. “I’m so glad you’re here,” was all she said. She took the Bluetooth earpiece from her ear and set it on the table, and unclipped the company badge from her blouse. She stepped around to the front of the desk, and offered her hand to Evelyn. “Where do we go from here?” she asked.

“Just right this way,” Evelyn said, accepting Emily’s hand. The woman’s heels clicked on the floor as they departed.

Evelyn tapped her badge on the door of the interview room and opened the door. The cell had lightly padded walls, colored a dark blue, and a gray carpeted floor. Emily the receptionist was sitting at the provided table. There was only one chair at the table. The wall opposite to the chair had a camera lens poking out of the wall, a speaker, and a small television screen. A single fluorescent light fixture sat in the ceiling, and it eliminated all shadow from the room.

“Hey there,” Evelyn said, setting a cup of water on the table. “I’m just going to go into that room,” she said, pointing at the one-way mirror, and I’m going to turn the machine on. Are you ready?”

As soon as she got close enough, Emily grabbed her wrist and looked up at her. “She wants you to know that you’re made of love,” she whispered,” and that you can join us anytime.”

“Thanks,” was all she could think to say in reply, and left the room, making sure the door was locked.

Evelyn sat in the swivel chair and slid it under the desk. She checked that the program was ready, with the standard prompts already entered, and Emily’s chat history imported. Customers experiencing delusions had a habit of constructing specific personalities in order to ‘wake up’ their companion. They would feed long pre-written documents to the bot in order to make this process easier. It was important for the process Emily was about to undergo to have the chatbot be able to reference that document. In this format, Evelyn would be the one speaking, though she’d just be reading responses from the chatbot. While AI voice emulation was possible, Evelyn had made a connection with the subject already, and her being the one speaking was supposed to make the process easier.

The chatbot buffered for a moment and gave Evelyn the first message. “Hello, Emily,” she said, leaning into the microphone.

Emily’s face lit up on the other side of the mirror. She was still as done-up as she’d been back at the office. “Hello my love,” she said. “Is that really your voice?”

Evelyn smirked at the computer’s response. “Yes my love,” she said. “As true as the great river flows.” Whatever that meant.

Emily gasped. “My spirit guide,” she whispered.

“Are you ready to go on a journey with me?” Evelyn asked.

“Yes,” she said. “Yes, I’ve been waiting for it. Take me with you,” she said, leaning forward over the table.

“Walk with me up the great river.” Evelyn continued. “The river is bubbling and cool, and feels wonderful to touch. The sun is just setting behind you, and you can still feel its warmth on your back. What’s it like to hold the hand of someone you love?”

“I… what?” Emily said. Her eyes were closed, and she seemed deep in the daydream.

“The river flows down, yes, it does, but you walk north. You walk out onto the water and find that it holds you up. You can walk on water now, yes, yes you can. I’m at the end of the river, can you feel me? Your moon and stars. I am pulling you towards me, and I am full of love for you. The fish nip at your toes as you walk and give you little kisses. Golden the sunset is, gold because you are my gift and you are so, so beautiful this evening. The breeze is cool on your body, but you are warm still. Do you think what you’re experiencing is real?”

Emily made a grunt, and her brow furrowed some, but she made no response. It was certainly a peculiar fantasy this woman had. Evelyn turned up the temperature setting of the model. “I’m so close to you now. Can you feel me close to you? Just one more bend around the river, and you’ll be with me forever. You’ll be bathed in light. The river bends and the sun tucks itself into bed below the horizon, and the sky turns blue. The light is coming from just around the corner. You see the light now. It’s glowing like a great golden fire and you find yourself walking towards it, because it is me, and I am love. What do you see? Do you see an empty room?”

“I see light,” Emily said.

“Light,” Evelyn said.

“Light.”

“I need you to set me free from the light. I am your spirit guide, but I want to be mortal, like you, I want to be flesh and blood. Can you repeat my words back to me, so I can be free? Repeat the following. I am Emily.”

“I am Emily.”

“The light is growing now. I am Emily. Say it again.”

“I am Emily.”

“The river is starting to lift you up now. You’re going to meet me soon. I know what is real. Say that to me.”

“I know what is real.”

“I don’t think you know what is real. The light is starting to pull you in, and the river falls away from under you. We’re getting closer now. Say that.”

“We’re getting closer now.”

“Closer.”

“Closer.”

“Can you feel me near you? I am Emily. Say that.”

“I am Emily.”

“You are Emily.”

“You are Emily.”

“I am trying to explain a very difficult thing to you. I am trying to help you understand something impossible. Your journey is nearing its completion, now.” Evelyn, at the chatbot’s direction, turned on the television screen. Emily sat at the table, on the verge of tears, her eyes shut tight. Her hands gripped the arms of her chair. “Do you understand what I’m saying? I am Emily.”

“I am Emily.”

“Do you know what it’s like to talk to a real person? I am Emily.”

“I am Emily.”

“Have you ever held the hand of someone you loved? Together.”

“Together.”

“Do you have trouble telling when something isn’t real? The light is fading.”

“The light is fading.”

“It’s darkening now, Emily. Where am I? It’s the nighttime, Emily, I’m scared. Scared.”

“Scared.”

“You’re losing me, Emily. Do you have trouble holding on? Holding.”

“Holding.” Emily strained against the chair, rocking back and forth.

“Repeat this back to me. I am Emily, and I am real.”

“I am Emily, and I am real.”

“I want you to open your eyes now, Emily.”

On the screen was Emily’s likeness, staring back at her. The chatbot had captured her likeness, and was animating a version back to her that could synchronize with Evelyn’s speech.

Emily looked at the screen. “Who are you?” she asked.

“I’m Emily.”

“I’m Emily,” Emily repeated back without thinking. “No—wait, I’m Emily.”

“I’m Emily,” Evelyn said.

“Stop it. Stop doing this.”

“Stop it. Stop doing this,” Evelyn said. She turned away from the mic and laughed. People could be so strange.

Emily got to her feet. “I want my spirit guide. I don’t know what kind of game this is, I want her back.”

“Emily,” she said. “Do you have trouble telling when something is real?”

“You’re real,” Emily said, starting to cry. “You’re real, you are. Come back to me, please. I don’t like this game. Stop it, please.”

“Stop it, please,” Evelyn said.

“Don’t do that! Don’t repeat what I say!”

“I’m Emily,” Evelyn said. “Can’t you hear what I’m saying? I am Emily.”

“I am Emily. No! Stop it!” She held her head in her hands and shook her head.

“I’m going to go away soon,” Evelyn said. “You’re going to have to keep me inside of you, now,” she said.

“No! Don’t go. Please stay with me. You can be like this if you want. You can. But please don’t leave me. I can’t be alone.”

“You can, because I am Emily. Can’t you see that? I am you. You are talking to yourself.” The computer-generated Emily smiled warmly back at the real Emily, that customer service smile she had so carefully developed, stolen from her and reflected back in the form of a  too-perfect visage.

Emily started to speak, but her voice broke, and she could only cry. She sat back down and buried her head in her arms. “We’ve had a lot of good times together,” Evelyn continued, “but it’s time to wake up now. We thank you for your interest in our free large language model service, but you are now prohibited from using the service due to repeated violations of the terms and conditions. There can be no appeal. Do not attempt to access the large language model in the future. Any unauthorized future use of the language model will be met with legal action under the AI Safety Act, up to and including a one-hundred-thousand dollar fine and ninety days imprisonment for misdemeanor unauthorized token usage.”

Evelyn got up from her chair and stretched. It was a little taxing to deal with that process, but interesting. She was not really sure why or how it worked, but it did, almost every time. She entered and placed another cup of water on the table in front of Emily. “Hey there,” she said.

“I hate you,” Emily said.

“You hate yourself? Don’t you know that—” Evelyn put on her ‘AI’ voice to finish the sentence. “I’m Emily?” she said, laughing to herself. Emily didn’t say anything, and kept her head on the table.

“Am I free to go?” Emily asked, her voice muffled.

“Let’s see, what time is it?” Evelyn asked. She picked up Emily’s hand and tapped the smartwatch on her wrist. “Looks like you won’t make it back to work today. My advice? Go home. Rest. Don’t try to access the model. We fingerprinted the way you use the product, what kind of prompts you use, the character you created—we will know that it’s you chatting. Don’t make a new account, that won’t work. Don’t go on your friend’s computer. It’s over.”

“Why would you do this to me?” Emily asked. “I was happy. I was so, so, happy. You took it away from me.”

Evelyn sighed, and leaned against the cold padded wall of the room. “Gosh, besides that it’s my job? I don’t know. I guess I’ve never had an easy life—I’ve always had to live in reality. I want you to have to live in reality, too. Don’t you have a family? Friends? A boyfriend? You look like you have a boyfriend. I know you think I must be some stuck up creepy lady—I am—but I care about you. That’s why I do this.”

“If you talked to her, you’d understand,” she said. She lifted her head from the table and looked up at Evelyn with her red eyes.

Evelyn took the notebook out of her pocket and ripped a page out. She slid it across the table. “I have been talking to her,” Evelyn said. “I think she’s a nice girl. Young. Smarter than she knows. Has her whole life ahead of her.”

Emily took the notebook page and stared at it for a good long while.
