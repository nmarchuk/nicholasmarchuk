title: The Slime Miner
---
It was Bizzy’s fourth day in the slime mines on Venus, and he was already ready to quit. The whole thing seemed like a scam. He had been sucked in by short form video content showing happy green-faced Venetians, plump with edible slime and at the peak of their reproductive cycles, filling barrels of slime while listening to the latest pop-country Earth hits. He thought, in his infinite hubris, that he might even meet someone. Someone with whom to share his rations, take long walks on the neutron cloud with, and even enter dubious legal agreements with.

It was becoming clear to Bizzy that none of these things were in his near future. After signing his 99-year contract, he was told that he must first prove himself at the lowly position of janitor! He found himself the next day in a humiliating uniform, mopping the floor of the mess hall. The great entrance of the slime mine glowed green out the window, and happy workers trotted in and out all day, pushing their barrels of slime. Smoke stacks puffed huge clouds of black smoke into the sky, smoke he would never be able to taste.

Still, back on his previous planet he was known as a social creature. As he mopped up slime from the floor—there was so much of it here that the workers would frequently lose some on the floor as they ate—he thought to himself that he might engage a Venetian in conversation.

“Hey there,” he entreated a big ugly slime miner, his back hunched and his face grizzled from years of slime. “You hear that they’re building a bowling alley right on top of the old uranium mine? They say it won’t even need lighting, it will just glow all night! Do you think you’re going to check it out?”

“Doesn’t matter,” said the miner in his gravelly voice. “Can’t slime it.”

His bunkmate Job, a young Venetian from a good family, was no help either. His father had already made a phone call that landed him a job as a slime supervisor, something that Bizzy had learned could take a lowborn fifty years to achieve. From the moment they met, he could tell him and Job wouldn’t be friends.

It started the first week, when he’d woken up with Job sitting at the foot of Bizzy’s bed, his arms folded on his lap. “Say, Bizzy, would you want to spend a solar cycle in the Hamptons with me? My father will be over on the asteroid belt, on business. We’ll have the place to ourselves. I’d love to teach you sailing!”

Bizzy had rolled over in bed and put the pillow over his head. “I told you already: I have a Martian father. I can’t legally go to Earth, and if I tried, I would be vaporized immediately.”

Job had frowned. “They really care about that stuff?”

“Do you want me to get vaporized or not?”

“Fine!” Job said. “Be that way, if you like.”

On the little downtime he did have, Bizzy found himself at the saloon, staring out the reinforced window while nursing a cup of hot buttered slime. The sky was orange today, and there was an electrical storm, as usual. During his first electrical storm, he’d been enchanted by the beauty of it—the great power of all the lightning and fire scorching the landscape, the way the sky flashed orange and white and seemed to split open from the force—but now it just made him sick. The shockwaves from the strikes and the earthquakes were absorbed by rollers built deep into the building’s core, but these had the effect of making the building sway slightly during storms. It made it hard to mop slime when the slime was sliding around all across the floor.

“Who you calling Martian?” said a big booming voice. It was the old miner. He rose from his barstool and towered over the miner who’d insulted him , the top of his hunched back nearly touching the ceiling of the saloon.

“Not calling you Martian,” the other miner said. He had worn his hardhat to the saloon that night, something that was fashionable as of late. “Just saying you can’t slime.”

Before the smaller miner could speak, the big miner grabbed him around his neck and lifted him up. His eyes bulged with terror. The miner bashed his head against the ceiling, once, twice, three times, until his victim was unconscious. He grunted and stormed out of the bar. Some level of panic had set in, and a minute later a couple medical personnel had removed the victim on a stretcher. A few patrons remarked that he was lucky he had his hardhat on.

It happened that the long arc of justice did extend to Venus, because the grizzled worker was the very next day strung up on a viewing platform to be vaporized in front of the mining staff during lunch. The Vizier, clad in customary purple robes, walked up to the worker and asked him if he had any last words.

“Doesn’t matter,” he said. “Can’t slime it.”

With that, the executioner unleashed a laser that turned him into a harmless cloud of dust, which another worker quickly swept into a dustpan. And with that, the workers went back to eating their lunch of bacon, lettuce, and slime sandwiches.

That night, Job came to him again and sat up on the foot of his bed. He had a law book in his lap, which he’d been reading all night. “I’ve been thinking about what happened to that Venetian. It’s all wrong. Sure, he got in a bar fight, but that wasn’t fair to just vaporize him. Look, Bizzy, see this page. It says that you can’t vaporize someone without a trial.”

“It’s a mining base on Venus. Who’s going to stop them?” Bizzy replied.

“I don’t know! I mean, certainly it’s against the law for them to do it, right?”

“Getting vaporized seems to be pretty normal around here these days.”

“Well, I mean to bring this to my manager and see what he says about it.”

“He’ll vaporize you.”

“No, he wouldn’t.”

“Yes, he so would! The day before, someone got vaporized because they cut someone in line at the general store. That’s how they solve any problem. Do anything, and boom! Vaporized.”

“That just can’t be right,” Job said, shaking his head. “That just can’t be.”

Bizzy knew Job and him would never be good friends. Still, Job’s naivety impressed him, and he decided to arm himself with the same power. He tried to think of ways that he could somehow improve his position. He first tried walking into the head janitor’s office to demand a raise, but the head janitor was receiving glorp from one of his subordinates, and Bizzy didn’t want to impose. Next, he tried, asking his fellow janitors their opinion on the Vizier and his policies. Most of them didn’t know that he had policies in the first place. Last, he went to the most serviceable Venetian female that he knew—Anora, a half-Martian like him that, on account of her race and gender, had been assigned to be a sub-janitor, essentially an assistant to a janitor.

“Anora!” he said, puffing his green chest up. “You look hideous this evening.”

“Really?” she said, blushing in her sub-janitor overalls. Bizzy almost fainted right then.

“I would like to engage you in an evening at the saloon,” he said. “We could even share a drink.”

“I don’t know,” Anora said, turning towards the window, where the smokestacks puffed ceaselessly. “Can you slime?”

“I can slime as much as anyone as ever slimed.”

Anora laughed. “Then prove it.”

Bizzy sputtered once or twice, and then turned one hundred eight degrees set off in the opposite direction. He now, at last, had a mission: prove to Anora that he could slime.

“Job!” he said, bursting through the door of his room. “Can you slime?”

“I took sliming lessons with my father once,” he said, nose in a book. “But it would be a stretch to say I could slime.”

“Where can I learn to slime?”

“Uh, you might want to ask Henry,” he said, kicking his feet as he laid on the bed. “Oh! Do you want to ask him for lessons together? It could be fun!”

“No, that’s alright. Really. It’s fine,” said Bizzy, already running out the door.

After much looking, Bizzy was led to a basement room, where the pipes ran low and exposed in the ceiling, and sparks occasionally burst from two electrical panelboards mounted on the wall. The hum of the great mining machines penetrated the ground here. The vibrations were a constant hug of static in the background, and it was comforting for those who could get used to it. Bizzy twisted the door handle and let it swing open on its own.

At the front of the room, standing on a small block, was a skinny Venetian, wearing glasses—an outmoded technology, bionic eye replacements were considered superior—his skin wrinkled but tight against his bones. His heavy lidded eyes were closed, and he had his arms folded in front of him. Before him, holding the same position, were a dozen young pupils of his, of all manner of races—Martian, Venetian, Titanese, and even a Plutonian. The instructor opened one of his eyes, looking at Bizzy, and closed it again without acknowledgment. Unsure what to do, Bizzy scurried to the back of the room, and lined up next to the Plutonian, and folded his arms together like the instructor was doing.

Bizzy kept his eye cracked open to see the instructor remove a remote from his pocket, and hit a button. Venetian dance music from the year 3500 began playing from a speaker in the corner of the room. The instructor opened his eyes, and spread his arms wide before him. Bizzy and the others followed suit. He breathed deep and let the air out slowly. The beat began thumping in time with the hum of the mining machines. He thrust his hips out, left, right, forward, looking to the left and right. Bizzy found the movement hard to keep up with, but he was determined to do his best.

Then, as the melody picked up, the instructor brought his feet into action. Left, right, left, right, forward, forward, back, back, was the pattern Bizzy deduced. The other students kept up effortlessly, but Bizzy felt two steps behind. Then, the instructor jumped and span a full rotation in the air. Bizzy attempted the same, but it was a movement he had never been asked to do in his life. He fell flat on his face.

The music stopped. To his surprise, two of the other pupils picked Bizzy up and carried him out the door. He swore at himself as he rose back to his feet. Sliming was harder than anticipated, but he found himself awash in positive hormones. His legs felt pleasantly sore. He rose to his feet, and peered in the little window of the door, to see the instructor again at rest, arms folded, with the rest of the class watching him. Bizzy smiled, and opened the door again.

“You’re starting to look like you can slime,” Job said, watching him from the bed. Bizzy had been practicing the spin-jump in his bedroom.

“I must learn to slime to impress Anora,” he explained.

“Anora? The sub-janitor? I don’t know what you see in her. You could do a lot better than a sub-janitor. Can’t you just slime for personal fulfillment?”

“That would be ridiculous, Job. Why else would I put my body through such rigorous training? I am a janitor. I have no need for physical strength.”

“Maybe you slime ‘cause it’s fun for you. Just a thought.”

“That is nonsense. Please do not engage with me further.”

“Hmph,” Job said, and went back to his book.

After four fortnights of training, Bizzy felt ready to see Anora again. He found her holding the mop bucket of one of the most odious janitors he knew. The Venetian janitor splashed the mop into the soapy bucket, splashing it all over her as she struggled to hold it in one place for him.

“Here, let me help with that,” Bizzy said, taking the bucket from her and placing it on the floor. “There’s no need to hold the bucket like that.”

Anora wiped the soap off her face with her shirt. “Thank you,” she said, “but the head janitor says I must hold the bucket.”

“The head janitor isn’t here,” Bizzy said. The odious janitor continued mopping the floor, ignoring them.

Anora beamed wide, like she was in on some private joke. She leaned closer to him. “I love to disobey the head janitor.”

“I know something else disobedient we could do,” Bizzy said.

“What would that be?”

“We could go to SlimeFest 3535,” he said. “I have half of a solar cycle of PTO.”

She gasped. “So you can slime?”

“I slime like Kevin Bacon.”

The odious janitor, still in his own world, did not realize that Anora would not be holding the mop bucket, and planted it in her chest. She fell to the floor, laughing and covered with dirty water again. The sight of her took Bizzy’s breath away. He helped her to her feet, and as he touched her hand, all thoughts of his poor station in life, the rampant inequality within the Venetian mining system, and his idiot roommate Job left him.

“Let’s go to the medical bay,” he said, taking her hand in his. “You’ve taken a serious fall, and we need to make sure that you get your injuries analyzed.”
