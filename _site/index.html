Connor loves his neighborhood–the beautiful old buildings, underground music shows, and walkable living. He has an easy job painting exteriors with his best friends and his new girlfriend, Kara. He’s on his way to figuring out what he wants from life.
</p>
<p>
One day, a freight train derails in the town center, causing a raging inferno that spills toxic chemicals all over the neighborhood. Connor, his friends, and everyone he knows has to move. The music scene he has come to love evaporates overnight. Things take a turn for the worse when he finds out that the city plans to turn the disaster site into a park, leaving them without a place to live.
</p>
<p>
Kara comes to the group with a plan: they will recruit local musicians to put on a music festival where the neighborhood once stood, to convince the public that their community and way of life are worth saving. However, in a world that seems determined to leave them behind, they find that nothing comes easy.

Hey! Welcome to my website. This blog is where I'll be posting updates related to books I'm writing, music that I like, ideas that I had, and other long-form content. Blogging is something about that the internet seems to not be able to shake, no matter how much we try. At one point, we used to even do something called 'microblogging'. Remember that?
