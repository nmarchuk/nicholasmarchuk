<p>
Connor loves his neighborhood–the beautiful old buildings, underground music shows, and walkable living. He has an easy job painting exteriors with his best friends and his new girlfriend, Kara. He’s on his way to figuring out what he wants from life.
</p>
<p>
One day, a freight train derails in the town center, causing a raging inferno that spills toxic chemicals all over the neighborhood. Connor, his friends, and everyone he knows has to move. The music scene he has come to love evaporates overnight. Things take a turn for the worse when he finds out that the city plans to turn the disaster site into a park, leaving them without a place to live.
</p>
<p>
Kara comes to the group with a plan: they will recruit local musicians to put on a music festival where the neighborhood once stood, to convince the public that their community and way of life are worth saving. However, in a world that seems determined to leave them behind, they find that nothing comes easy.

<h3>why you should read this book</h3>
<p>The modern age has made us into hunters of good content. When we find content, we devour it hungrily. <em>This book is content.</em> It gives you things to talk about, smile about, think about. People who read this book find that they sound more clever, more well-read, and more open-minded. To be serious, I think you'll enjoy reading it!</p>
<p>I have tried hard to think of a way to fit this book into a genre, and I have come up short in some ways. I think it depends on your perspective. In many ways, it is a humor book. There are modern cultural references. Characters misremember common phrases, make mistakes when speaking, they encounter creeps and weirdos, they laugh and joke together like old friends. I want you to be friends with the people in this book, and get to know them a little, despite their flaws.</p>
<p>The book is a bit of a romance. I don't mean in the sense that it is smut or that there are dashing business magnates based on characters from Twilight. It is a book that has things to say about love. It contains information on what it means to love one another (or not), and what is interesting, painful, or good about that. It's something I think we should all be learning about as much as we can.</p>
