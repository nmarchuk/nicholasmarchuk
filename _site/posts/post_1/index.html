                <p>Hey! Welcome to my website. This blog is where I'll be posting updates related to books I'm writing, music that I like, ideas that I had, and other long-form content. Blogging is something about that the internet seems to not be able to shake, no matter how much we try. At one point, we used to even do something called 'microblogging'. Remember that?</p>
<p>I was a decent microblogger. I wrote a lot of funny things in that time of my life. But it ended up being a waste of my time. In your life, you can only write so many words. It happens that I write more words than the average person, so I can afford to waste some, but I'd rather not waste <em>too</em> many.</p>

<p>This is me, holding a puppy in Boquillas, Mexico. This visit was part of a trip I recently went on to Big Bend National Park in Texas. I recommend going, if you ever can. We went during the winter, and there was actually a polar vortex at the time, so it got down to 30 degrees at night. We camped outside in the desert, which proved to be a true test of will. Still, it was an amazing trip all around.</p>
<p>Something I learned from that experience is to be more grateful for the things we do have, like heat, food, and water. We would have a hot meal of instant mashed potatoes and beef jerky, with cold canned gravy on the side, and those meals were the ones that we enjoyed the most, because of how hungry and how cold we all were. That's a pretty common sentiment, but it's something I thought was good enough to note in a first blog post.</p>
