<h2>website</h2>
<p>This website is a static HTML, CSS, and JS website built with <a class="a inline" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy (11ty)</a>. I programmed, wrote, and deployed it myself. I think programming is a fun skill that anyone can and should learn. It has never been easier to build an 'old school' style website.</p>
<p>The font is <a class="a inline" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>. It's a font I love because it is the font for IntelliJ, the Java IDE. It is also free and open source.</p>

<h2>life</h2>
<p>For writing, the most formative experience in my life was what I experienced in high school. I was fortunate enough to take a self-directed creative writing course with a teacher by the name of Ms. Hocking, who gave me the confidence and tools to pursue this at a deeper level. There were a lot of other teachers at all levels of education that I also owe a debt to, mostly for their kindness and generosity with their time as I grew up.</p>
<p>I also owe a debt of gratitude to my parents and my friends. I hope that they all know how much they mean to me.</p>
