Enjoy your free sample of the first three chapters!

## Chapter 1

Vincent Reznor took a long, dry hit from his vape and closed his eyes. He clenched his jaw and felt his blood turn to molasses. The fish guts and dried blood caked onto his apron melted away, disappearing onto the pavement below. He could hear his knuckles turning white. A little tent formed in his jeans. Could life be any better? In a moment, the rush was over. He shivered, shook his head, and stuffed the vape in his pocket. His cousin always told him it was gay to vape, but it was cool to be gay now. He was living in the future.

The next thing he grabbed was the controller for his electric skateboard. He pushed forward on the remote, picking up speed as he passed through the back alley and out onto the main road. Another shift at the restaurant was behind him. He watched the ivy-laden brick rowhouses and vinyl triple deckers fly by, remnants of the past and present. The sun was beating down overhead, and that was righteous as well. He tilted his head skyward. Maybe he’d catch a tan. Maybe Mack, the girl at the record store around the block, would let him hit on her break. Fuck yeah.

He took his phone from his pocket and shuffled the music he was listening to. It played some junk from a local band. He didn’t love that stuff so much, but these were local guys, and it was important to support them. They might be stupid geeks who make bad art rock who should know their place and not fucking talk to his girl at the record store, but at least they were from around here. The chorus on this song was especially loud. The guitars crashed and burned together with the kick drum and the cymbals. Vincent liked loud.

 A thought came to him about how he could make the moment even better. He pulled his vape from his pocket and ripped another long hit. “RAAAAAH!” he shouted, stretching his arms out wide, willing his board to go faster until the wheels shook and rattled. A shadow flashed in the edge of his perception.

The front wheels of his board jammed into the exposed rail of the train tracks that crossed the road before him. He flipped head over heels onto the gray cracked pavement ahead, smearing blood and dirt onto his apron. He gathered his wits, caught his breath. He’d gotten ahead of himself. That was alright, another scar to show Mack later. Maybe she’d wrap it up for him, he’d say he was doing something brave. He’d gotten a serious burn on his back from the road, and he writhed on the pavement, trying to move past it. Then the sound of bells came.

The arm that blocks the railroad crossing was on its way down, the regular chiming of the bells announcing the arrival of a train. Vincent looked around to make sure he wasn’t in its path. He saw he was a few feet beyond it. Okay, whatever. He breathed for a moment, them remembered his board. Where the hell was his board? If he could have made a list of his most prized possessions, the board probably came second on it after his vape. He saw it, still laying across the tracks, and it called to him. He reached his bloodied arm out at it, and that was when the train came. “My board!” he shouted, falling to his scraped knees, regretting it immediately. “Fuck, bro!” He fell back onto his back.

Squealing, a deafening crashing sound that seemed to never end. The sound of metal crunching and cracking and folding in on itself. The belching of black smoke and sparks flying. The sound of an old wooden building buckling and falling. The roar of the locomotive as it lay in a ditch, engine still running. The mile-long train had derailed, each successive car being thrown off the tracks and forced into nearby buildings and cars and each other. Vincent felt white hot metal chunks being thrown at him, burning him, biting at his skin and his clothes. He crawled in reverse, unable to look away from the explosion. What had he done? The twisted rail cars built up until the train could go no further. The last car ground to a halt in the middle of the road, the place he’d just crossed now impassable.

A raven flew overhead, fleeing all that he had wrought. He coughed on the dust that had been kicked all around, and watched it settle. His apron had turned shades of brown and red. Probably needed a new one; chef wouldn’t like that. This whole situation was bananas. Mack was never gonna believe it. Things were quiet otherwise. He heard what sounded like a campfire, crackling, burning near him. From near the locomotive, a plume of smoke shot hundreds of feet in the air, an eruption beyond description, raining fire and ash down on the place that was kind of nowhere. It was a plume of red and orange from hell itself, bloody and angry and punishing. He saw the raven fall from the sky, its wings beating weakly against the smoke but unable to stay airborne. It fell to the ground by him, where it lay dead. And then a sickness not unlike sleep took him.

## Chapter 2

Connor let his bicycle skid to a stop in the hard gravel on the side of the road. At the edge of the forest, he leaned it against a tree. The job site, which he and his fellow painters had been toiling at for several days, was an aging rail bridge, just outside of town. Several metal trusses with wide support columns were bolted into concrete blocks, set deep into the earth. The metal on the old bridge has begun to rust, and already the off-white chipped paint had run red.

He and his friends were painted exteriors for a living. Today, their task was to restore the white finish of the bridge, paint over any graffiti they found in the area, and stay out of trouble. The area was an artificial valley where the railroad had plowed through a hill, leaving steep stone block retaining walls on either side. He rumbled down the slope of the hill and ducked under a low branch, revealing the site. Three men were already up on ladders and working. Two of them were his closest friends, Nigel and Pablo. They were ‘adoptive’ twin brothers as they liked to say, with no relation that Connor knew about. The third was Stirbert, who he liked, but was less close to. Probably on account of him being the son of his boss.

“Cheers, Connor,” Nigel said, leaning off the side of his ladder and waving his brush. “How ya been?”

“Nothing at all, man,” Connor replied. Nigel was a British fellow, about thirty, friendly in the face, balding, with an even temperament. It was strange that he ended up here. Pablo also shouted a greeting, but was too busy bending in an awkward position, trying to reach a difficult corner. Connor picked up a nearly full bucket of paint from the ground, and pried the lid off. He dipped his finger in the mixture and watched it drip back into the bucket. As a child, he’d always had a non-serious urge to taste the thick, sticky paint, just because the texture seemed appealing. Now the idea made him rightfully sick, but the texture still appealed to him.

He set his backpack on the ground and removed a speaker, queuing the first few songs of the day on his phone. It wasn’t his preference to stick with an album or a playlist, instead trying to choose the right songs manually for every moment. He hit play and got to work.

“Man, I like this one!” Pablo said, coming uncurled from the awkward position he was in. “This shit is junk!”

It was junk. Junk was the name of an upcoming musical style that was born in their small town, and had begun to spread regionally. It started when a few Ohioan transplants took their emo musical traditions to the winding rivers and bucolic rolling hills of New Jersey, and mixed it with the local style. The result was music that was at times egregiously loud, and at other times only moderately loud, with doses of yearning and longing mixed in. The music was incredibly unpopular with people over thirty-five, and the legend was at one point, a sorry Gen X-er had referred to it as ‘junk music’, and the name had stuck. Now the popular thing was to say the opposite of what you meant. Calling a song junk, trash, filthy, or even stinky, was the highest compliment.

When Connor first started, he had wondered if he would struggle for recognition by the other painters. While they had all grown close by now, he was nervous at the time. He sought to impress them with his music taste. Neither Pablo nor Nigel were from the area, like Connor was, and so they didn’t know as much about Junk. When they’d given him a chance on aux, he’d taken a risk and played that music. It turned out that music that civilized adults found grating was the perfect background music for painters with one or two screws loose. When they weren’t rocking out to Junk, the conversation flowed easily. Nigel was a natural conversationalist, patient but also able to contribute in his own right.

“500 upstrokes for my new post!” Nigel exclaimed, as he checked his phone. With his other hand, he wiped paint on his coveralls. Nigel was the only one left of them with social media, but he had a quirky way of going about it: He’d found an app specifically for painters. The verification process was arduous, and it involved submitting several photos showing you next to something you’d painted, which were manually reviewed by moderators. Pablo had been helping Nigel put together an application when Connor first started working there.

“Give me that,” Connor said, hopping down from his ladder. He took the phone from Nigel’s hand. “Let’s see what the old man has to say.”

“Every crew has that one guy named Nigel,” he read aloud. “Then there’s several laughing emojis.” There were indeed 500 upstrokes on the post, and twenty-five ‘repaints’, as it were.

Nigel tried to swipe his phone back, but Connor dodged him. “C’mon, that’s too easy!” Connor laughed. “They don’t know that’s you. Get outta here.”

“Lying on the internet,” Pablo muttered. “Sad to see what my brother has come to.”

“No lying was involved,” Nigel explained, finally getting his phone back from Connor. He stuffed it in his breast pocket. “And all good writers write what they know. Even a child knows that.”

Nigel returned to his crevice. “A child, yes. Even Stirbert,” Pablo said, laughing. The guys had been teasing Stirbert all day, and he was taking it well, though he hadn’t piped up very often. He was still learning the ins and outs of the job, and was a little younger than the rest of them, still in college.

Painting was not a hard job, at least to Connor, since the work didn’t command a lot of technical accuracy. Connor had started to find that the more he painted, he could see differences in how professional and amateur jobs looked. There was something about the evenness of well-applied strokes and the care with which the more talented painters (like Pablo) could cover even the most forgotten corners of a surface. It was satisfying to watch, and more satisfying to experience himself.

Before long, it was lunchtime, and they sat on various medium sized boulders by the tracks to eat their packed lunches. Connor had made himself an egg salad sandwich that morning, light on the mayonnaise and heavy on the mustard, the opposite of how his parents preferred it. The four of them all cracked open a Boom, the local energy drink everyone in town seemed to drink.

It was then that he heard the breaking of twigs and footsteps up on top of the hill, behind the trees. They came in groups of three, like whoever was out there was alternately running and then catching themselves from falling. He saw the feet of the mysterious runner first, as they approached the low branch. A moment later, they collided head first with the low branch and fell backwards to the ground. They rolled down the hill, bouncing a few times, before landing on the gravel by the train tracks.

“Ow, fuck!” the woman’s voice shouted. On the ground was a girl about Connor’s age, wearing ill-fitting denim overalls, now stained by the dirt and gravel from her tumble. She wore black work boots with yellow laces, and a tie dyed under shirt. Her black hair was cut a little above her shoulders. Pablo was already over to help her to her feet.

“Another new hire?” Pablo smiled. He checked to see if she was alright.

“Yeah,” she said, rubbing her forehead where it had contacted the branch. “For now.”

Connor had had no idea that a new person would be coming along that day. He reached out his hand to shake hers. “Connor,” he said.

She stretched out her arm to meet his, and their eyes met. "Connor,” she said, as if testing the name out. “I’m Kara.” She sort of squeezed his hand once, not shaking it, the handshake of someone who was rarely invited to shake hands. He studied her face for the half second it took to let her hand go. A smirk, or maybe a half-smirk, like the Mona Lisa. An expression that you could write a thinkpiece about what it really meant. There was not much to say about her outfit, other than that it worked in her favor. It seemed like she might take care of her eyebrows. After categorizing all that information, processing it, and returning to reality, he realized what it meant—he found her attractive.

He grabbed a spare brush, and handed it to her. “Shall we?” he asked.

“Sure,” she said, dusting her pants off. “Let’s try this.”

He had her follow him to where he had been working. He dipped the brush into the paint, and watched it drip back into the bucket. “So, this isn’t a hard job,” he said. “It’s an easy job. You can’t really do it wrong. We just have to cover the entire surface in a single color. Just like, make it look new again. But still, what’s worth not doing wrong is worth doing right.”

“I don’t think I’ve heard that one before,” she replied. She squinted at the paintbrush he’d given her. “Did you make it up?”

“Isn’t everything made up?” Connor said. That answer was good enough. Maybe he’d made it up, he couldn’t be sure. Maybe, more accurately, the words had appeared on the tip of his tongue, and he’d spat them out without realizing. He looked up at the rusted metal beam, and began to paint, and she watched him intently.

He instructed her to try a little on her own, and returned to his work. The darkened white of the existing paint had flaked off in pieces, and larger wafers in spots. Lots of things were flat—fake hardwood floors, computer screens, the sky. Rust was different. He could look at a bit of a rusted bridge for an hour and not run out of things to see in it. Streaks of the red iron rand own the metal beam like tears, staining the concrete blocks below before disappearing into the gravel and weeds.

“Everything requires maintenance,” he said, working as he spoke. “Except for nature. That goes on its own. You have to do stuff like this to keep the world turning.”

A red chip got stuck in his brush. “See,” he said. “A straggler.” He shook it out of the brush. “These bits don’t really matter, but I don’t really like when they get in the bucket.

“Okay,” she said. “Am I doing it right?”

He looked. She’d covered a few square feet of beam in white paint. No drips on the ground, or missed spots. The brushwork was even and parallel. The divots in the beam had been carefully covered, but not filled with paint.

“Kara,” he said. “Are you an artist?”

“I draw,” she said, chuckling a little. “Who doesn’t draw?”

Connor didn’t draw. He blinked. “This is great,” he said, feeling the ears of his coworkers perking up as he said so. “Well, uh, some things here and there of course. You’ll pick it up with time. There will have to be some more training.”

She nodded politely, and started again, further down the beam.

“There’s one thing, though,” Connor said. “Before all that paint dries. You’ll want to leave your mark now, since the part you did is around eye level. Easier to see.”

“My mark?” she asked. “I don’t know. Isn’t it a little crude to sign your name like this/ Like a kid sticking their hand in wet concrete?”

“Nothing so crude,” he replied. “Look here,” he said, pointing up at a higher portion of the beam. From a distance it was just plain white, but on closer inspection, the brush strokes made a swirling pattern, with a little extra paint, enough for the form to reveal itself in the right light.

“Do you see it? The trick is to do it all in one stroke.”

“Oh, yes!” she said, standing on her tiptoes to see better. “That’s pretty rad. I see what you mean, though. Let me think.”

She removed a pocketknife from her pants and unsheathed it, looking at the blade for a moment. She walked up to the beam, so close that he thought her nose may accidentally touch the paint. From his vantage point it was hard to tell what she was doing, but she seemed to meticulously cutting at the paint, scraping it, moving it. She wiped the knife on her pants. She picked up a piece of rust that had flaked on the ground, and crushed it between her fingers. It stained them red. She gently mixed the powder into the drying paint where she’d been working, and spread it around until it was a slightly warmer shade of white.

After some last adjustments, she stepped back. “There. I’m done.” The white color of the beam now had a square inlaid in it, of a warmer, darker shade of white, barely noticeable if you weren’t looking directly at it. The square was rotated slightly, as if one of its corners was being lifted from the ground. The border between the broad strokes of the painting around it, and the refined surface of the square was crisp. It held his attention for some reason.

“Did you come up with this?” he asked.

“No,” she said, starting to paint again in another spot. She seemed eager to work. “Malevich, an old painter. It’s his work, White on White, it’s called. You know, from around when it was cool to just paint a shape. It was edgy and cool to throw a shape out there and call it art. Malevich, he at least had some reasons for It. He was upset that art had too much to do with the material world. Lots of things were happening, during his time. He wanted the form of the art to be supreme, above the material.”

Connor thought for a moment. “And you being here today, putting his square on this beam, saying it’s yours, how’s that work? Would he be upset?”

She turned her head towards his and grinned. “Well, he didn’t want it to mean anything, you know, in the real world. Form only. To me, he may as well have put it in the public domain. So maybe it’s mine.” She put her brush down and pulled the hair off the back of her neck. Tattooed there was a square, rotated a few degrees to the right.

A slow rumble came from beneath them. A paint bucket resting on a railroad tie began rattling in place. “Train!” Nigel shouted, hopping down from his ladder. The men made quick work of moving their equipment to safety. Connor grabbed the bucket and the brush Kara had set down. Kara started up the embankment, as the train horn started to blare. The conductor seemed angry today.

“No!” he shouted. “Here!” he pointed beside him. He leaned against the stone wall that was just feet from the edge of the tracks. Kara shrugged, and hopped back down the hill, walking over to stand beside him. Nigel, Pablo, and Stirbert stood on the other side.

The train’s horn cried louder and louder as it approached. Black birds flew from the nearby trees. The engineers hated people on the tracks. Connor shut his eyes and turned his head to the right, not wanting to see it approach. He dug his nails into the bricks as the rumbling grew louder, the anticipation unbearable. Why they did this to themselves he could never explain. Kara shrank further against the wall, and then looked left. Not to him, but past him, staring down the moving train. A moment passed and the train was upon them, car after car hurtling by. The wind revealed the black square on her neck. Another moment passed and it was gone.

## Chapter 3

The painters sat around a table at the Stinky Rat, a twenty-four hour diner in town. “Welcome,” Pablo said, as the waitress placed a milkshake in front of Kara.

“Every painter who does honest work is entitled to an honest milkshake, at the end of the day.”

“It’s an old tradition,” Nigel said. “It’s said that the painters who once worked on the Roman aqueducts would eat grapes at the end of the day. Not nearly as delectable, but the sentiment is similar.”

“Grapes?” Pablo asked.

“They had grapes in Rome. I’m sure of it.”

“Either way,” Pablo said, waving off Nigel’s comments. “This is a most honorable and fitting treat for a worker such as yourself. They see you with a drink like this, and they know you put in an honest day’s work.” He grinned.

“Where’d you learn words like that, Pablo? Honorable and fitting?” Nigel asked.

“The thing they say about becoming wise, is that it happens when you least expect it. Perhaps I became wise right when I walked in the door this morning—maybe it was last week. Who can know? I’m wise enough to defer judgment on the subject.” They all laughed at that.

Connor watched as Kara’s eyes scanned the restaurant, as he took a long sip of his own drink. It was relatively well-attended, for it being 8 o’clock on a weeknight. The walls were painted crimson, and had photos framed of various politicians shaking hands with the waitstaff on the walls. Some guitars, signed with signatures unreadable, hung from the ceiling near the bar, which was built of the vernacular corrugated metal known to be used in the archetypal diner.

“So, Kara,” Nigel said.

“New girl,” Pablo added.

“Yeah, quite new,” she said.

“What’s your story?” he asked. “How’d you end up somewhere like this? This place is kind of nowhere.”

“Seems like a nice restaurant,” she said, smirking. Connor thought she glanced at him for a second.

“Yeah, she’s got a point,” Connor said.

“But really—“ Pablo said. “—what’s this place got to do with you?”

She stirred her milkshake and looked out at the window. A car hummed by. “I’m from two towns over.”

“How do you reckon?” Nigel asked.

“Well, this place is Kind of Nowhere. Down the main road, there’s Someplace Else, and then if you head north a little ways, that’s where I’m from. Way Out There.”
“Is that near Somewhere?” Stirbert asked. He was from Somewhere, so of course he’d ask that.

“They had a petition to rename it Getting Somewhere, but it never caught on,” she said. “Anyway, you know, growing up there was fine. I have nothing to report on that end. It’s just slow there. My mom and dad get along fine, they are together still. I have an older brother, but he’s a bit older, so we don’t talk much. I don’t know what else to say. My name is Kara, I have a degree in planning from the school that’s near here, and a fun fact about me is… I’m very flexible!”

“Flexible! That’s a boring one.”

“Please don’t demonstrate,” Stirbert added.

“Planning, how’s that go?” Connor asked. He had an idea, but he liked her manner of speaking. It was refreshing to have someone new to question.

“Well, it’s a bit like plotting, less like scheming, though there’s some common ancestry to them,” she said, laughing.

“Oh,” Connor said. He wasn’t sure what to say to that. “Alright.”

“But you’re not planning, right now?” Pablo asked.

“No plans,” she said. Her milkshake was nearly empty now, and it had only been minutes since she’d gotten it. “New job, new town. New crew. That’s my plan right now, to get used to all of that. I wanted to have a job planning, but it didn’t work out.”

“It’s good to work,” Pablo said. “That much is true. So, I commend you for playing your part in society.” He had this habit of offering comments that sounded like advice, but were really just statements.

“I don’t know,” she said. “It’s good that we can take care of columns, walls, whatever needs taking care of. But is it art?”

“Why’s it matter if it’s art?” Stirbert asked, frowning. “It’s got to be done.”

“No, she’s right,” Pablo said. “It’s good that you are confronting this so early. Your mind, Stirbert, is too focused on… the checks, the bills. Numbers that go in and out, up and down. As workers we should evaluate our place in the machine, what role we play.”

“And if you’re so smart, then what’s it all mean?” Kara smirked. “What’s the answer?”

“Meaning, yes. Say we all say tomorrow, that we won’t paint the bridge. Maybe someone else comes and paints the beams. Maybe not. Maybe I work for less so I can paint bridges and things we need instead of painting bombs red at the bomb factory. Maybe I go into painting because I think being a real estate agent—which I would be very good at, mind you—is unethical. But art? There is no art in it. We’re getting paid! We sold out, maybe. Say for example that tomorrow I don’t feel creative, I don’t have any inspiration to make art. The dream, it escapes me for a moment. Still, I need money, so I show up tomorrow and paint something awful. I have not created art. It is the destruction of art. If I knew French, I’d say a terrible and beautiful French phrase that summed it all up.”

“Mise en place,” Stirbert said, solemnly.

“Yes!” Pablo said, thrusting his open hand towards Stirbert. “The boy is right. Mise en place. Perfect.”

“Meaning without art,” she said. “Okay, I’ll have to think about that.”

The sound of a guitar broke the flow of their conversation. Over at the back wall was a small stage raised a foot above the ground, and a band had set up. Droning tones sounded through the restaurant as they began to tune.

“Whoa,” Kara said. “Live music?”

“It never ends,” Pablo said, rubbing his forehead. “No, it’s good, it’s good. But it never ends. Truly. There is music all the time.”

Kara nodded happily. “Pretty cool right?” Connor said. “The guitarist is my buddy from high school.” He pointed at a flannel-wearing man frowning at an amp.

“Wow,” she said. “You play guitar?”

“No,” he said, which was the truth. “But I think that like, my conversations with him might inform his playing. Inspiration, you know. Something like that.”

Connor remembered a late night at his friend’s mom’s house. He was playing some guitar solo for Connor, hammering on, pulling off, traipsing along the pentatonic scale with ease, playing as many notes as he pleased. He’d asked Connor what he thought about it after. Connor had said that it was good, but it didn’t seem like he was playing for any good reason. Just playing for the sake of it. That comment had made things awkward for a bit.

“That makes sense,” she said. The band started to play, and she turned in her seat to watch.

*And now we ride the circus wheel*

*And it’s your brother’s favorite wheel*

*He says it’s good to ride a wheel*

*But now he’s dead and can’t ride the wheel*

*The Earth looks better on a screen*

*Than it does on amphetamines*

*He didn’t think that you would cry*

*When he rode the wheel with another guy*

*The circus can really break your heart*

*The way they treat those elephants is not art*

Nigel turned back to face the group. “Not sure what that one is about,” he said.

“It’s a classic,” Connor said. “They are covering a song, by the Last Actuaries. They are some of the fathers of Junk music. Everything changed when this song came out.”
“Yeah, the part where he rides a ferris wheel really moved me,” Nigel said, sarcastically.

Connor listened to the song as they went over the chorus again. “It’s a sad song,” he noted.

“What happened to that band?” Kara said. “Can we see them live?”

Nigel made a face, and Pablo did too. Stirbert laughed as well. “They, uh, did some bad things,” Connor said. “You know how it is. Nobody likes to talk much about it. Maybe that’s a flaw on our part.”

“That’s nice,” she said, tapping her straw in her empty glass. “That’s nice.”

Pablo stood. “I’ve got some things to take care of back at home.”

Nigel stood as well. “I was going to lay in bed,” he said. “But I’ll head out as well. Shall we?”

They walked from the restaurant out onto the street. They all lived in or around the west end of town, the denser, older part of the city. The street grid seemed to predate the invention of the grid. People said that they were former cattle paths. Some roads were only ten feet wide, not enough to drive a vehicle down, paved with cobblestones that were sinking more and more with time. The sidewalks were of brick, and the buildings were largely brick as well. They were old, three stories high, usually, and they leaned. They leaned over the road, away from it, and the narrowness of the roads amplified that feeling. The canyons, some people called it.

They continued their journey down the road before turning down an alleyway. This one had concrete walls, which were painted with graffiti. The tags blended into one another, a sea of neon colors, some faded, and some fresh. A rat scuttled under a hole in the low part of the wall. They scooted past where a row of city trash cans were 
“This is so cool,” Kara said. “I need to get out here more often.”

“We like it. It’s ours,” Pablo said. “Well, it belongs to the community.”

“You could add something, sometime,” Connor said. “Maybe not during the day.”

“That would be nice,” she replied.

The first stop was towards the end of the alley, a hallway cut into the concrete, a door at the end of it. Pablo had to duck his head to go down the hallway. He made his way to the red door, turned around, saluted, before ducking inside. The others wished him well as he left.

They passed back onto a wider street, with more stately buildings and a couple chain stores. The main grocery store was on this road, but it was a locally owned joint, the kind where things were just too expensive to shop there every day. It was the kind of place you’d go if you ran out of eggs in the middle of making pancakes. Everyone liked and respected the owner, a plump man of about forty who was a generational citizen of the neighborhood, but not enough to not go to the supermarket outside town for groceries, when they could.

Stirbert’s apartment was on this road. A brownstone, white in color, the masonry aged yellow with time, crawling with green vines. A dog was tied up outside to the fence, and it scowled and howled at Stirbert as he walked up. Pablo had joked once that it was as if the dog knew that Stirbert had a silly name. The gang stood at a distance as he approached. The dog strained at the end of its leash, an old bully, brown and snarling. He performed the same feat every time, waiting until he got to the end of the dog’s radius, before dashing down the path to the front door of his building, where the dog couldn’t reach him. He waved with one hand as he ducked inside, safe. This act always amused them.

They walked more, and passed a homeless man in a wheelchair. They didn’t know his name, and hadn’t bothered to ask. They believed he lived in some form of public housing. He sat in his chair, banging a cup of change against the armrest. He had taken, in the last few years, to setting a beat with the banging of his cup, something simple and syncopated. They appreciated the music, so they’d give him a dollar when they had one, placing it in his cup.

“Isn’t that guy wearing Jordans? He needs our money?” Kara asked, after she watched Connor give him loose change.

“Yeah, he’s really cool,” Connor said.

“He’s a top lad,” Nigel added. The Britishism was well met by Connor.

Nigel was next. He lived closer to the edge of the neighborhood, in a three-floor building with vinyl siding, and a distinctive bumped out window bay at the front of the building. To enter, he would scamper up a set of wooden stairs inelegantly added to the front of the building, when it had been converted to multifamily. During the winter, it could be treacherous, and Nigel’s landlord was a useless creep, who couldn’t be bothered to have someone clean the snow. They often joked that Nigel was just waiting to slip and fall, so that he might get a settlement of some kind.

Connor and Kara were the last, standing out on the sidewalk together. She said she lived close, but Connor insisted he walk her home. Down the street, he pointed out a building to her, a friendly duplex tucked in between two larger buildings. It seemed in need of a fresh coat of paint, and a new roof.

“What, we’re gonna paint it?” she asked.

“No, this one is called The Kingdom of Joy. It looks like a regular house during the day, which it is. But at night, the basement is the coolest place to be in. It gets really loud.”

“Really?” she asked. “That’s so cool.”

“Yeah. You have to be insanely good to get to play a show there. And know the right people. Especially know the right people, it seems, lately. It’s too bad. Things have gotten so competitive.”

“I love stuff like that,” she said. “I had no idea that was here. Would you ever show me?”

She nodded happily. “Okay. I’m excited.”
