<p>Lineman is a free, online-only collection of short stories about the edges of the human experience. These stories capture specific moods and ideas that reflect people who find themselves for some reason outside society at large.</p>
<p>The predicament of these characters is viewed with care and levity, as Lineman takes you across the galaxy: From a miner on the planet Venus, to a society that loves baseball more than anything else, to a man who thinks he may have dissolved the corpse of his landlord in a barrel, this collection is sure to keep readers guessing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I intend to update this collection infrequently. It is available for free to my newsletter subscribers.</p>
