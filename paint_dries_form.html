    As a reward, here's some questions I've gotten about the development of this book that I get from my friends.
</p>
<em>What inspired the book?</em>
<p>
    My primary motivation was to tell the story of urban renewal in Boston, more specifically that in the West End. To me the whole event seems to be like a cosmic horror of some kind and I wanted to tell some of that story. Urban Renewal there had nothing to do with train derailments; it was a result of political choices and class attitudes at the time.
</p>
<p>
    The train derailment piece is most closely inspired by East Palestine, Ohio, but not based on it. The closest analogue would be the Lac-MÃ©gantic disaster, something I stumbled across only after writing much of the book. The train being derailed by a skateboard is based on that exact thing happening in Boston to a Green Line train.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, much of the book veers off in the direction of personal relationships. None of the friendships and relationships in the book are exactly like ones I've had in real life. I prefer to imagine larger than life characters and make them interact to see what happens.
</p>

<em>Where is the book set?</em>
<p>
    Nominally the book is set in New Jersey, somewhere near Secaucus. If it had to be in one place, that would be Hoboken, a town I lived in for a couple months, but Hoboken is  denser than what I envisioned. The best analogue would probably be a Boston streetcar suburb with a dense downtown, like Somerville.
</p>

<em>How long did it take you to write it?</em>
<p>
    The first chapter (actually now the second chapter, since the scene with Vincent was moved first) I wrote on June 21, 2023, and then it was not touched until fall 2024. I finished the first draft March 1, 2025, and finished revising around July 1, 2025. I write every day.
